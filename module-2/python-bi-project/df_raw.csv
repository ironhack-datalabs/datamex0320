<p>Facebook was founded by <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg"" title=""Mark Zuckerberg"">Mark Zuckerberg</a> in February 2004, initially as an exclusive network for Harvard students. It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz"" title=""Dustin Moskovitz"">Dustin Moskovitz</a>, <a href=""/person/chris-hughes"" title=""Chris Hughes"" rel=""nofollow"">Chris Hughes</a>, and <a href=""/person/eduardo-saverin"" title=""Eduardo Saverin"" rel=""nofollow"">Eduardo Saverin</a> to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks. </p>

<p>The original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg&#8217;s high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.</p>

<p>With this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to <a href=""/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto"" title=""Palo Alto"" rel=""nofollow"">Palo Alto</a> for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of <a href=""/company/napster"" title=""Napster"" rel=""nofollow"">Napster</a>, <a href=""/person/sean-parker"" title=""Sean Parker"" rel=""nofollow"">Sean Parker</a>. Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg&#8217;s apartment and they began working together.  Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, <a href=""/person/peter-thiel"" title=""Peter Thiel"" rel=""nofollow"">Peter Thiel</a>, cofounder of <a href=""/company/paypal"" title=""PayPal"" rel=""nofollow"">PayPal</a> and managing partner of <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund"" title=""The Founders Fund"">The Founders Fund</a>. Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook. </p>

<p>With millions more users, <a href=""/company/friendster"" title=""Friendster"" rel=""nofollow"">Friendster</a> <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/"" title=""attempted"">attempted</a> to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners"" title=""Accel Partners"">Accel Partners</a>, at a valuation of <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/"" title=""around $100 million"">around $100 million</a>. Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock"" title=""Greylock Partners"">Greylock Partners</a> and <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners"" title=""Meritech Capital"">Meritech Capital</a>, as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/"" title=""opened"">opened</a> up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/"" title=""opened"">opened</a> to anyone with an email address. </p>

<p>In the summer of 2006, <a href=""/company/yahoo"" title=""Yahoo"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo</a> <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/"" title=""attempted to acquire"">attempted to acquire</a> the company for $1 billion dollars. <a href=""http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook"" title=""Reports"" rel=""nofollow"">Reports</a> actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo&#8217;s stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal.  Yahoo later <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/"" title=""offered"">offered</a> $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the &#8220;kid&#8221; who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; <a href=""/company/viacom"" title=""Viacom"" rel=""nofollow"">Viacom</a> had previously <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/"" title=""unsuccessfully"">unsuccessfully</a> attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006. </p>

<p>Not long after, in October 2007, <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/"" title=""Microsoft invested"">Microsoft invested</a> $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/"" title=""5th most valuable US Internet company"">5th most valuable US Internet company</a>, yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft&#8217;s decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google.</p>

<p>Facebook continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/"" title=""$1.5 billion round"">$1.5 billion round</a>, valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/"" title=""announced"">announced</a> that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012, opening on the NASDAQ with shares trading at <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/"" title=""$42.05"">$42.05</a>.</p>

<p>One sour note for Facebook has been the <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/"" title=""controversy"">controversy</a> with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook. The ordeal has <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/"" title=""gone to court"">gone to court</a>, and has now been <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/"" title=""resolved"">resolved</a>. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding this lingering controversy, Facebook&#8217;s growth has been staggering. Facebook announced <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/"" title=""astonishing numbers"">astonishing numbers</a> in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO.

Mobile users now make up half of Facebook&#8217;s user base, with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day. Facebook is one of the <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/"" title=""most trafficked sites"">most trafficked sites</a> in the US, and its international growth has been impressive. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.</p>

<p>History of Aol:</p>

<p>AOL was founded in the early 1980&#8217;s as Control Video Corp, with an online service, Gameline, for the Atari 2600 console.  In 1985 the company was re-named Quantum Computer Services and was the first online service launched for the Commodore 64 and 128 consoles. In 1988, the company created an online service for the PC and changed its name to AOL (America Online), becoming over the next decade the premier Online access subscription business, at one point having almost 25MM subscribers. </p>

<p>AOL originally went public in 1992 and grew to become the largest online access and portal company on the Web. In 2000, AOL acquired Time Warner for $160B+ in what was then considered to be the largest M&amp;A transaction, and the company was re-named AOL Time Warner. The merger was not fruitful and on May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL into a separate public company. The spinoff occurred on December 9, 2009, ending the eight-year relationship between the two companies.</p>

<p>Since then, AOL has focused on reinventing itself as a brand company under the guidance of CEO Tim Armstrong, creating and acquiring a range of content properties. Major acquisitions include the purchase of technology news blog TechCrunch in September 2010, and on March 7, 2011, the purchase of The Huffington Post. Other AOL brands include Moviefone, Engadget, Patch, Stylelist, MapQuest, Cambio and about.me.</p>","american-on-line, america-online",$1B

Originally inspired by <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/friendster"" title=""Friendster"">Friendster</a>, MySpace quickly grew to become the world&#8217;s largest social network, before being overtaken by <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook"" title=""Facebook"">Facebook</a>.

MySpace provides users with a way to connect around content and culture. </p>

<p>MySpace was started as a side project of the internet marketing company eUniverse (now called <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia"" title=""Intermix Media"">Intermix Media</a>) in August 2003. <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-greenspan"" title=""Brad Greenspan"">Brad Greenspan</a>, then founder and CEO of eUniverse oversaw the project, which was also led by <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe"" title=""Chris DeWolfe"">Chris DeWolfe</a> (later CEO), <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/josh-berman"" title=""Josh Berman"">Josh Berman</a>, and <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson"" title=""Tom Anderson"">Tom Anderson</a> (soon to be President). It officially launched in January 2004.</p>

<p>By February 2004, MySpace reached 1 million registered users. By November 2004, that number had reached 5 million. In July, 2005 <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation"" title=""News Corporation"">News Corporation</a> bought eUniverse (renaming it <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia"" title=""Intermix Media"">Intermix Media</a>) for $580 M, of which approximately $327 M was the valuation of MySpace. At this time, the site had 20 million registered users. In mid 2007, <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation"" title=""News Corporation"">News Corporation</a> contemplated selling 25% of MySpace stock to <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/yahoo"" title=""Yahoo!"">Yahoo!</a> in a deal that would have valued the site at $12 B, though this never went through. </p>

<p>After being acquired, MySpace&#8217;s revenues grew rapidly, as <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation"" title=""News Corporation"">News Corporation</a> pursued lucrative advertising deals. In August 2006, <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google"" title=""Google"">Google</a> made a $900 M agreement to provide search and advertising directly on the MySpace site, which is set to expire in June 2010.</p>

<p>In mid 2008, MySpace participated in a major site redesign. Throughout its history, critics have often cited the chaotic and disorganized interface as a severe drawback to usability of the site. This redesign made the main page more streamlined and clean.</p>

<p>In late 2006, <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/universal-music-group"" title=""Universal Music Group"">Universal Music Group</a> sued MySpace for millions in damages from copyright infringement. This suit was settled in mid 2008 by the launch of <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music"" title=""MySpace Music"">MySpace Music</a>, a site where users can listen to streaming songs from all sorts of artists. To supplement this venture, MySpace acquired <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ilike"" title=""iLike"">iLike</a> in mid 2009. MySpace had previously also launched a record label in 2005 and musicians such as Lily Allen and Sean Kingston were first discovered through MySpace.</p>

<p>In mid 2007, MySpace acquired <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket"" title=""PhotoBucket"">PhotoBucket</a> for $250 M in cash, plus an additional $50 M earn-out. By late 2009, <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation"" title=""News Corporation"">News Corporation</a> sold a 2/3 stake in <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket"" title=""Photobucket"">Photobucket</a> to a group of investors valuing the company at $60 M, over 80% less than the acquisition price.</p>

<p>Since 2008, user growth has stagnated and page views and other metrics have fallen. In April 2009, longtime CEO and co-founder <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe"" title=""Chris DeWolfe"">Chris DeWolfe</a> was replaced by <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta"" title=""Owen Van Natta"">Owen Van Natta</a>, in a publicized firing. President and head of product, <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson"" title=""Tom Anderson"">Tom Anderson</a>, was kept on, but in a different position. Two months following this, MySpace announced it was laying off 30% of its workforce amounting to 420 people.</p>

<p>In June 2011, Myspace was acquired by Specific Media for a <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/myspace-goes-to-specific-media-for-35m-ceo-is-out-press-release/"" title=""reported US$35 million"">reported US$35 million</a>.

The service, used by more than 4 million patients/month, currently serves 40 percent of the U.S. population across 1,900+ cities.</p>

<p>With the service, patients avoid the hassle of waiting on hold, searching for a good doctor or wondering whether a doctor takes a particular insurance. Participating health practitioners benefit by attracting new patients and alleviating the productivity lost from last minute cancellations.</p>

<p>In 2012, ZocDoc introduced its first major product since the company’s inception - ZocDoc Check-In. This feature allows patients to fill out their medical forms online in advance of their visit and saves the information for future visits as well. This capability, which was the #1 most requested feature to date, improves accuracy and convenience for patients and doctors alike.</p>

<p>In August 2013, ZocDoc introduced the ZocDoc Health Marketplace Resource – a destination providing patients with independent information and analysis of the Health Insurance Marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act, helping them make more informed healthcare choices. The resource’s most prominent feature - Care Access Grades – are letter grades assigned to each health insurer that indicate how easy it will be for patients to secure near-term appointments with in-network medical providers.

<p>Why Open Source Video?</p>

<p>The open-source approach accelerates adoption and spurs innovation that rapidly and cost-effectively enables a multitude of highly-integrated solutions for a wide variety of use cases and verticals.  While the platform itself is free, Kaltura profits by providing a wide range of value added services to its platform users.  Our open source cost structure coupled with our large and fast growing customer base enables us to deliver these services at competitive pricing, and provide customer with several main benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No vendor lock-in - setting up a video platform and integrating it into existing workflows takes time and money, regardless of which platform you use - Kaltura is open source, so you&#8217;re not locked in with a certain vendor, you have full access to the source code and can always continue to use the code, and your time and effort will never be wasted.</p></li>
<li><p>SaaS vs. On Prem - Kaltura is the only platform that can be deployed as a hosted solution (like the other platforms in the market), or as a self-hosted platform behind your own firewall. This provides full security and control for organizations that have an on premise deployment policy. You can also select a hybrid of the two, and migrate from SaaS to On Prem.</p></li>
<li><p>Application Exchange - Kaltura is the only provider that has an Application Exchange - a marketplace of add-ons, plug-ins, and applications that enhance the platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Highest level of: FLEXIBILITY - open source code that can be tweaked and changed according to specific needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Fastest pace of: INNOVATION - due to our global open source community of more than 10,000 members.</p></li>
<li><p>EASIEST integration with existing systems - Kaltura&#8217;s platform is modular and designed to fit into your existing systems and workflows. We have both pre-packaged extensions for leading CMS and LMS systems like Drupal, WordPress, Blackboard, Moodle and many more, as well as custom integration solutions for authentication systems, proprietary CMSs, payment systems, and more.</p></li>

The PRO exchange platform is designed to complement your existing TMS and provides a single web and mobile interface for carriers to interact with all of their customers.</p>

<p>History of uShip:<br/>
In many ways, uShip.com was born in the back of a rented moving van. As CEO and Founder Matt Chasen was moving from Seattle to Texas, his mother had been struggling to move a dresser from Ohio to Texas. When Matt arrived to pick up the 9-foot van he ordered, it was sold out, leaving him with a 20-foot truck. As he drove the virtually empty truck to Texas, he wondered if there may be someone in a similar situation in Ohio with enough room to bring home his mother&#8217;s dresser. Matt continued to tinker with the idea over the coming year, and when he arrived at the University of Texas, he eventually joined with fellow business school students Jay Manickam and Mickey Millsap. The three further developed the business plan to take advantage of all these empty trucks to make shipping more affordable. In its first five years, more than 800,000 shipments were listed on uShip, and at any given time between $10-13 million in transport jobs are available on its marketplace.</p>",,$44.7M

<p>Prezi was officially launched in 2009 by co-founders Adam Somlai-Fischer, Peter Halacsy and Peter Arvai. </p>

<p>Adam Somlai-Fischer is an internationally renowned architect and visual artist who has been working with zooming presentations since 2001. Adam found that a zoomable user interface (ZUI) enabled him to explore the &#8220;big picture&#8221; overview of a floor plan and then zoom into the detail of individual rooms. Because there was no commercially-available zooming presentation editor, each presentation had to be coded by hand. Audiences were wowed and approached Adam to discover what presentation software he used. A few persuaded him to give them access to his code. Finally, in 2007, Budapest University of Technology professor Peter Halacsy convinced Adam to develop an editor so that anyone could make zooming presentations. After creating a prototype, they recruited a business-minded entrepreneur, Peter Arvai, to join as CEO to help them build a product and a company. Prezi was launched in April 2009 from Budapest, leading to investments from TED Conferences and Sunstone Capital. The San Francisco office was established in November 2009. </p>","zooming-user-interface, flex, flash, presentation, presentation-tool, presentation-editor",$14.3M

<p>The development of PCH saw a criss-cross of activity across the globe from Donoughmore, Co. Cork in Ireland to Shenzhen, Guangdong Province in China. The journey saw Liam Casey start his career in fashion retail with Tricot Marine, moving to the United States to work for a trading company, before finally landing in Shenzhen, China.

Fundamentally, Smart Capacity solutions enable operators to improve the utilization and performance of their existing network capacity as subscriber data traffic continues to escalate.</p>

<p>Numerous operators worldwide have experienced increasing pressure on capacity as a result of traffic congestion caused by faster networks, more sophisticated devices, richer content, and consumer demand for bandwidth-intensive applications such as high-definition (HD) video, streaming media, and one-to-one video communications (video chat). This trend, which has impacted operatorsâ€™ data revenue growth and profitability, is expected to continue with the commercial roll-out of Long Term Evolution (LTE) and other 4G networks.</p>

<p>Bytemobileâ€™s products are designed to deliver Smart Capacity to mobile networks â€“ without the traditional requirement for new wireless spectrum or infrastructure build-out. The principal benefits to operators are: 1) better control of network capital and operating costs in the face of increasing traffic congestion; and 2) consistently higher quality of experience (QoE) for subscriber s accessing video and web services on mobile devices. Superior QoE leads to improved customer acquisition, retention, service adoption, and data usage â€“ and therefore increased revenue growth.</p>

<p>Bytemobile offers operators two Smart Capacity platforms: 1) the Unison(TM) Platform, which is carrier-grade software deployed on industry-standard server hardware for processing video and web traffic through mobile networks; and 2) the T3000 Adaptive Traffic Management System (T-Series), which consists of a fully integrated network element, deployed in the core, for managing traffic across Layers 2-7 of the network stack. Bytemobile Smart Capacity applications include video optimization, web optimization, content caching, policy control, traffic management, and network analytics.</p>

<p>Bytemobile was founded in 2000 to optimize high-bandwidth data services on wireless networks designed for low-bandwidth voice services. In 2001, the company completed its first commercial network deployments. Today, Bytemobile has deployed more than 125 mobile network operators in over 60 countries. A few of the company&#8217;s customers are AT&amp;T, China Mobile, China Telecom, Cricket Communications, Deutsche Telekom, Indosat, MetroPCS, O2, Orange, TelefÃ³nica, TeliaSonera, and Vodafone.</p>

About the size of a thick credit card, EDG makes it easy (no computer needed) for companies to showcase their custom audio/video or slide show information where it can be viewed on the cardâ€™s 2â€ high-resolution LCD color screen.  The video and variable volume capabilities make it an ideal medium for communicating to clients and prospects.  Content can be loaded one time or changed repeatedly through the cardâ€™s USB port that simultaneously charges the card battery.</p>

<p>Beyond the obvious attraction to its smart design, EDG is an affordable interactive information delivery tool that can be used to build business and communicate with prospects.  Specifically, EDG can be used as a digital press release or portfolio, an event memento, a contest mechanism, a code-compliant (pharmaceutical) education tool, a destination souvenir, a frequent flyer membership card, a trade show giveaway, a direct mail video brochure, a product manual, a language learning device, and much more.  </p>

<p>The benefits of this unique delivery system:
â€¢ Content is managed/updated via the Internet         â€¢ Affordably priced for bulk purchase
â€¢ Usage can be tracked and measured               â€¢ Both the skin (fascia) and content can be branded
â€¢ Easy to convert existing content to load on EDG         â€¢ Controlled content â€“ only the buyer can change it
â€¢ Simple to use design (no manual needed)             â€¢ Small size is easy to carry 
â€¢ Private relationship-building tool                  â€¢ Generates revenue through membership/ad fees</p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<p>Veeam was founded in 2006 by Ratmir Timashev and Andrei Baronov, and originally had 10 employees. In August 2006, Veeam launched their first commercial product: Veeam Monitor. This application allowed monitoring and resource management for VMware Virtual Machines (VMs). A month later, Veeam announced a new product called FastSCP - a free tool to create and deploy ISO-based backup copies of VMs. FastSCP became extremely popular and widely used. In 2008, Veeam successfully launched <a href=""http://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html"" title=""Veeam Backup &amp; Replication"" rel=""nofollow"">Veeam Backup &amp; Replication</a>. This innovative product supported fast file-level recovery and VM migration inside VMware environments. Future focus was on the development and marketing for Veeam Backup &amp; Replication. In 2010, Veeam Backup &amp; Replication won the Best of Show and New Technology awards in VMworld. Veeam’s flagship product grew so quickly, it was used by more than 20,000 customers worldwide in 2011. Once Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v6 was released, Veeam expanded its business to Microsoft Hyper-V users. As Veeam continued to grow, so did the awards, such as in 2012 where Veeam Backup &amp; Replication won VMworld’s Best Virtualization and Server Consolidation, Best of Show and Best Virtualization for Disaster Recovery awards. Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v7 was released in August 2013 and is used by more than 73,000 customers worldwide.</p>","vmware-backup, hyper-v-backup, vsphere-replication, vmware-backup-solutions, vmware-replication, vm-backup, esxi-backup, vmware-backup-software, hyper-v-replication, backup-vmware, virtual-machine-backup, backup-hyper-v, free-vmware-backup, backup-esxi, v",$0

<p>A. Harrison Barnes, the Founder and CEO of LawCrossing, started his career as an attorney himself.

<p>LawCrossing closely monitors and analyzes the recruiting and hiring needs of more than 250,000 legal employers.  These employers belong to virtually every law firm, corporation, government office, and public interest organization in the United States and LawCrossing helps them in getting the right job candidates.

We have built up a network of recruiters who themselves are lawyers and have gone to top law schools and often worked for BigLaw firms before joining our team. We have been successful in placing thousands of attorneys in reputed law firms and in firms practicing in niche legal markets. </p>

<p>In 2008 and 2009, when the legal market was at its lowest in recent history, our recruiters were still able to place our clients in well-paid positions. Our list of placements includes partners as well. The reason for this is that BCG Attorney Search has a method of training recruiters in making placements that produces outstanding results for our clients. </p>

<p>We expect our recruiters to represent attorneys with the same level of commitment, drive, and insight that outstanding attorneys demonstrate when representing their clients. Our recruiters are trained in-house by our CEO A. Harrison Barnes through an intensive training program created from his own experience as a legal recruiter and input from other top recruiters.</p>

<p>Our recruiters also have a team of researchers at their disposal who study and analyze the latest trends in the legal market. We have offices in Century City, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Newport Beach and Washington, D.C. </p>

<p>We also publish in-depth market reports and reports on the best law schools in the country. Our report on law schools, The BCG Attorney Search Guide to America&#8217;s Top 50 Law Schools, is now considered an essential reference source for most American law firms. We also publish state of the market reports for attorneys, the latest of which is State of the Market Report Summer 2011.

As the worldâ€™s first commercial ultra-miniature laser-scanning technology, PicoP uses highly efficient laser light sources to display vivid widescreen images with high contrast and brightness up to and over 8 feet diagonally  in size.</p>

<p>MicroVisionâ€™s products address the unmet need facing growing mobility marketsâ€“consumers want a far bigger viewing experience than they currently get from small mobile device displays. Considering the growth of YouTube, flip video cameras and Apple devices, consumers themselves are increasingly the content creators, and sharing those creations in the real-world has meant squinting and huddling around a small screen. The PicoP laser display engine is small and low power enough to be embedded directly into devices such as smartphones, media players, camcorders and tablets. MicroVision is collaborating with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the telecommunications, gaming and consumer electronics markets to create new experiences that free consumers from the small screen in addition to creating new opportunities for carriers, content producers and brand marketers.</p>

<p>In vertical markets, such as automotive, aviation, medical and defense, there is strong demand for innovative display and imaging products that overcome todayâ€™s limitations. For example, the PicoP laser display engine can be embedded into a vehicle or integrated into a portable standalone aftermarket device to create a head-up display (HUD), placing critical information directly on the windshield of an automobile or into see-through eyewear displays. MicroVision is working closely with various automotive suppliers including Pioneer, which is targeting commercial introduction of an in-vehicle HUD using PicoP technology for the consumer market in 2012. The company has also entered into contracts with commercial and government customers to develop high-definition, see-through eyewear displays.</p>",,$110M

Soon after starting Novas, SpringSoft established Silicon Canvas to market, sell, and support the Laker system. A third company, Novaflow, was set up in Japan in 2000, as a distributor for both the verification enhancement and custom IC design products. SpringSoft later backed another company, ForteLink, which was developing hardware-assisted verification technology.

With more than 20 years of experience, the company is one of the pioneers in this field.</p>

<p>As a leading German security specialist, Avira has sound experience in the development and support of its solutions. In addition to programs specifically for use on single workstations, Avira primarily offers professional solutions for cross-system protection of networks on various levels. These include products for workstations, file, mail and web servers. Gateway computers can be managed as workstation computers via a central management console for all operating systems. In addition to the management products of the individual solutions, security programs for PDAs, smartphones and embedded devices are also offered. Our clients include renowned national and international corporations, educational institutions and public clients. Avira AntiVir Personal, used by millions of private users, represents a significant contribution to security.</p>

<p>In Tettnang, near the Lake Constance Avira is one of the biggest regional entrepreneurs. The company has several locations in Germany and partnerships in Europe, Asia and America. Worldwide approximately 300 persons are employed. Dozens of researchers in various virus labs attend to local and global threats on the virus front around the clock. This work is acknowledged, for example, by several test awards with the VB 100% of the Virus Bulletin or by repeated TÃœV certification.</p>

<p>As a technological leader in the Unix market, Avira develops leading-edge standards. Other Avira innovations include virus protection solutions for Symbian and the worldâ€™s first SAP-certified virus protection.</p>

<p>In addition to intelligent technologies, Avira offers solution-oriented advice and individual support from our own experts under the motto â€œMore than Securityâ€. Protection of users with Avira AntiVir Personal represents a significant contribution to security and a further additional firewall for corporate networks.</p>

<p>Awards and certifications of the Avira products and partnerships with corporations such as IBM, Sun, Novell, AVM or Clearswift underline the efficiency and core competency of the company. Security solutions from Avira are in demand worldwide and immediately available locally via trained, authorized partners.</p>

<p>Distributed all over the world, many integration partners directly implement the Avira AntiVir scan engine â€œSavapiâ€ in OEM products. Savapi and the underlying scanning technology are characterized by cross-platform and processor-independent programming. This includes use with Windows and Linux as well as on Intel and non-Intel processors. Thanks to the use of resource-saving programming technologies, Avira products have low RAM requirements.</p>

<p>In addition, Avira constantly adapts to the current security requirements of the users. AntiVir is therefore one of the worlds first ever products with dialer detection. This dialer detection was very quickly followed by the detection and removal of adware and spyware. Current developments in this field include the detection of already active root kits. The introduction of a firewall and behavior blockers is a matter of course. In-house development also allows the development of various new special scanning technologies, for example for PDAs, handhelds and embedded devices.</p>

<p>Aviraâ€™s national and international customers include renowned corporations listed on the stock exchange but also educational institutions and public authorities. In addition to protection of the virtual environment, Avira also provides for more protection and security in the real world by supporting the Auerbach Foundation. Established by the founder of the company, the Auerbach Foundation promotes charitable and social projects as well as the arts, culture and science.</p>","antivirus, antivir, free-av, security, windows, linux, solaris, central-management, gateway",$0
