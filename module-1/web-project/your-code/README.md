The sources used on this projet are:

1.- A CSV file from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/scoleman/spacex-launch-data

2.- An API from sacex:
https://docs.spacexdata.com/?version=latest#02badaab-e03e-40c8-ab20-3bc76d95d401

3.- An a table from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches

# Process

I´ve tunrned all the sources onto CSV files to call them on a new ipynb file.

Each CSV have been cleaned partialy.

The WEB_project.ipynb is the file where all the data frames (from the csv´s) are joined and cleaned again to standarize the data
