Much of what\'s on offer these days is of poor quality, and even academically excellent programs are no assurance of concrete rewards.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> \n<p class="inread-parent"><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive=""></fbs-ad></p> \n<div class="recirc-unit"><div class="recirc-title"><span>Today In: <a class="recirc-channel seo-title-default-gray" href="https://www.forbes.com/technology">Tech</a></span><button class="recirc-toggle recirc-closed" aria-label="Today In Tech"><svg class="fs-icon fs-icon--chevron-down" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 19.8 19.8"><path transform="rotate(-134.999 7.586 10.187)" d="M2.8 9h9.5v2.4H2.8z"></path><path transform="rotate(-45.001 12.615 10.187)" d="M7.9 9h9.5v2.4H7.9z"></path></svg></button></div><ul class="recirc-story-list"><li class="recirc-story"><a class="recirc-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2020/03/30/venture-capital-firm-general-catalyst-raises-23-billion-amid-coronavirus-crisis/"><h3 class="recirc-headline" data-ga-track="SEO Recirc Unit: 4">Venture Capital Firm General Catalyst Raises $2.3 Billion Amid Coronavirus Crisis.</h3></a></li><li class="recirc-story"><a class="recirc-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2020/03/29/e-pluribus-unum-shared-sacrifice-will-be-needed-to-beat-coronavirus-says-documentarian-ken-burns/"><h3 class="recirc-headline" data-ga-track="SEO Recirc Unit: 5">E Pluribus Unum: Shared Sacrifice Will Be Needed To Beat Coronavirus Says Documentarian Ken Burns</h3></a></li><li class="recirc-story"><a class="recirc-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2020/03/27/kevin-durants-business-partner-rich-kleiman-on-how-star-athletes-are-handling-the-coronavirus-crisis/"><h3 class="recirc-headline" data-ga-track="SEO Recirc Unit: 6">Kevin Durant\xe2\x80\x99s Business Partner Rich Kleiman On How Star Athletes Are Handling The Coronavirus Crisis.</h3></a></li></ul></div><p>Piatetsky disagreed, arguing that the proliferation of these programs is \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable response to industry demand\xe2\x80\x9d and predicting that \xe2\x80\x9cmarket forces will take care of the weeding out of weaker degrees.\xe2\x80\x9d Argamon, for his part, had strong words of his own: \xe2\x80\x9cThe development of data science degree programs is absolutely necessary. We all know that there is a clear need now and in the foreseeable future for many more data science professionals. These people need to have the strong statistical knowledge, software engineering ability, and communication skills which only a well-designed multidisciplinary program can provide. This distinct body of knowledge and skills cannot be conveyed by traditional educational programs such as statistics or computer science.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> \n<p>Indeed, there is no doubt that the proliferation of these graduate programs is driven by various estimates of the current meager supply and expected high demand in the future of people skilled at data analysis (see <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/big_data_the_next_frontier_for_innovation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/big_data_the_next_frontier_for_innovation" aria-label="MGI">MGI</a> and <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2207915" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2207915" aria-label="Gartner">Gartner</a>).&nbsp; Yet Brown warns of jumping to conclusions regarding the expected return on investment on these programs and points to the lack of agreement on what constitutes data science: \xe2\x80\x9cMoney is not the only reward of education, yet it is surely the primary selling point used to market data science programs, and the primary motivator for students. But there\'s no clear definition of data science and no clear understanding of what knowledge employers are willing to pay for, or how much they will pay, now or in the future. Already I know many competent, diligent data analysts who are unemployed or underemployed. So, I am highly skeptical that the students who will invest their time and money in data science programs will reap the rewards they have been led to expect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> \n<div class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""></div> \n<p>Argamon agrees that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are as yet no standards for data science curriculum content\xe2\x80\x9d which leads to differences in the quality and nature of the educational experience in the programs on offer today. But unlike Brown, he finds a silver lining in the lack of consensus regarding data science and thinks that the very proliferation of these programs \xe2\x80\x9cshines the attention on data science education that will help us evolve such standards.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> \n<p>There is more or less a consensus about the lack of consensus regarding a clear definition of data science. And no lack of complaints about the murky situation. See, for example, Robin Bloor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="http://insideanalysis.com/2013/08/a-data-science-rant/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://insideanalysis.com/2013/08/a-data-science-rant/" aria-label="Data Science Rant">Data Science Rant</a>\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cThese two words, when conjoined, are utterly misleading.\xe2\x80\x9d &nbsp;Bloor\xe2\x80\x99s rant is \xe2\x80\x9cphilosophical,\xe2\x80\x9d but I can share empirical evidence about both the current fuzziness and the prominence of the term. I learned from a recent Department of Defense DARPA announcement, <a href="http://www.zyn.com/sbir/sbres/sbir/dod/darpa/darpasb133-002.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.zyn.com/sbir/sbres/sbir/dod/darpa/darpasb133-002.htm" aria-label="asking for proposals">asking for proposals</a> to investigate \xe2\x80\x9cthe national security threat posed by public data,\xe2\x80\x9d that there are \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples of data science,\xe2\x80\x9d presumed to be understood by all potential proposers (the exact language is \xe2\x80\x9cBased on principles of data science, develop tools to characterize and assess the nature, persistence, and quality of the data\xe2\x80\x9d). Intrigued, I emailed Dr. Christopher White, the \xe2\x80\x9cTopic Author,\xe2\x80\x9d and asked what he meant by \xe2\x80\x9cPrinciples of Data Science\xe2\x80\x9d and whether he can point me to a relevant reference. His answer: \xe2\x80\x9cMy usage was general, like \xe2\x80\x98natural science.\xe2\x80\x99 There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a specific reference.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> \n<p>Just as the lack of clarity and established principles do not stand in the way of using \xe2\x80\x9cdata science\xe2\x80\x9d in requests for proposals, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t slowed down the sprouting of new graduate programs with \xe2\x80\x9cdata science\xe2\x80\x9d in their names. In addition to the one at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), there are, for example, the Master of Information and Data Science from UC Berkeley\xe2\x80\x99s iSchool (online only), MSc in Data Science and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/management/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/management/" aria-label="Management">Management</a> from Imperial College (London), MS in Data Science from <a href="http://www.forbes.com/colleges/new-york-university/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/colleges/new-york-university/" aria-label="New York University">New York University</a>, Graduate Certificate of Advanced Studies in Data Science from <a href="http://www.forbes.com/colleges/syracuse-university/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/colleges/syracuse-university/" aria-label="Syracuse University">Syracuse University</a>\xe2\x80\x99s School of Information Studies, and the Certification of Professional Achievement in Data Sciences from Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s Institute for Data Sciences and Engineering.</p> \n<p>Until the launch of these programs this year, <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2013/02/education-analytics-data-mining-trends-overview.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.kdnuggets.com/2013/02/education-analytics-data-mining-trends-overview.html" aria-label="\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness Analytics\xe2\x80\x9d used to be the most popular term">\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness Analytics\xe2\x80\x9d used to be the most popular term</a> used in the name of these programs. I asked IIT\xe2\x80\x99s Argamon why they went with \xe2\x80\x9cdata science\xe2\x80\x9d instead. &nbsp;\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Data scientist\xe2\x80\x99 as a job title is significantly trending upwards,\xe2\x80\x9d Argamon says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile \xe2\x80\x98analyst\xe2\x80\x99 is trending downwards (as is the more specific title \xe2\x80\x98data analyst\xe2\x80\x99). A second consideration (perhaps related to these trends) is that "analytics" is both too specific as well as too general a term. Data analysis is just one part of data science\xe2\x80\xa6 In our view, the term \xe2\x80\x98data science\xe2\x80\x99 more clearly delineates the field we seek to teach\xe2\x80\x94technically rigorous statistics, machine learning, and scalable computation, together with&nbsp; practical training in working with data, developing meaningful visualizations, and communicating usefully with a variety of non-technical stakeholders.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> \n<p>Are we seeing the eclipse of a term\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbusiness analytics\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which became a buzzword only six or seven years ago? The sudden emergence in 2007 of graduate programs in \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness analytics\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned above can be attributed to a single paper that launched the term into buzzwordom: Tom Davenport\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Harvard <a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/business/" aria-label="Business">Business</a> Review</em> article \xe2\x80\x9cCompeting on Analytics,\xe2\x80\x9d published in January of 2006.</p> \n<p>But \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness analytics\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94which replaced \xe2\x80\x9cdata mining\xe2\x80\x9d as the term of choice for describing the analysis of data\xe2\x80\x94was soon to be eclipsed by the rise of new players, new participants, and new tools and technologies. \xe2\x80\x9cBig Data\xe2\x80\x9d changed the landscape. The \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x99 guard tried for a while to jump on the new bandwagon by using \xe2\x80\x9cbig data analytics,\xe2\x80\x9d but the new players persisted and eventually took over the discussion with a new term: Data Science.</p> \n<p>In October 2012, Davenport (with DJ Patil) heralded again the dawn of a new era by publishing \xe2\x80\x9cData Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century,\xe2\x80\x9d again in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>. Davenport was also instrumental earlier in his career in the success of \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness process re-engineering\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP),\xe2\x80\x9d so his ability to call a major trend and his timing are indisputable. Guided by Davenport\xe2\x80\x99s uncanny intuition (ignoring his hedging of bets with <a href="http://iianalytics.com/a3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://iianalytics.com/a3/" aria-label="Analytics 3.0">Analytics 3.0</a>), and assuming that the rise of one buzzword signals the beginning of the decline of the one it is replacing, I conclude that the half-life of a buzzword (at least in the case of \xe2\x80\x9canalytics\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness analytics\xe2\x80\x9d) is exactly 81 months, the time that passed between the publication of Davenport\xe2\x80\x99s article on analytics and the one on data scientists.</p> \n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cData Science\xe2\x80\x9d could disappear, to be eclipsed by the next buzzword. But it may stick around, just like another incongruous joining of two words, \xe2\x80\x9ccomputer science,\xe2\x80\x9d did. This will happen, I predict, only if it becomes, like computer science, an established and well-defined discipline, with its own academic departments and all the necessary paraphernalia such as professional associations, journals, conferences, and awards.</p> \n<p><em><strong>Follow me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/GilPress" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/GilPress" aria-label="@GilPress">@GilPress</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/WhatsTheBigData" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.facebook.com/WhatsTheBigData" aria-label="Facebook">Facebook</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/107692092938784952176/posts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://plus.google.com/u/0/107692092938784952176/posts" aria-label="Google+">Google+&nbsp;</a></strong></em></p></div><div class="bottom-contrib-block"><div class="contrib-byline"><a class="fs-author-avatar" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/" title="Photo of Gil Press"><img class="fs-author-image" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b78310455670efb1202d65b44264c64?s=400&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" alt="Gil Press"></a><div class="contrib-info"><div class="author-wrapper"><a class="author-name contrib-byline-author speakable-author" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/" data-ga-track="contrib block byline">Gil Press</a></div><div class="follow-author-tag"><div id="lightbox-inline-form-a353475e-0a6e-4952-b67b-b966220a3643"></div></div></div></div><div class="contrib-bio"><div class="contributor-about__initial-description"><p class="author-description"><p>I\'m Managing Partner at gPress, a marketing, publishing, research and education consultancy.

However, ensuring that you find something that\xe2\x80\x99s effective and still safe can be a little trickier than you think, especially considering how common compound chemicals are, and how these chemicals can affect our health.</p><p>Air purifiers are no exception to that rule. It can be challenging to find one that effectively cleans the air, fits your lifestyle, falls within your price range and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like an outdated radiator. When in doubt, it\xe2\x80\x99s best to turn to tried-and-true brands and products with excellent user reviews. Finds evaluated these eight air purifiers by their efficiency (how many germs they claim to suck up), their appearance (is it aesthetically pleasing?) and price (no explanation needed here). From desktop fans to state-of-the-art machines, here are eight of the best and most versatile air purifiers on the market.</p><h2><strong>Alen BreatheSmart Classic Large Room Air Purifier</strong></h2>[id=7]<p>Do you have a big home? Not a problem with the Alen BreatheSmart Classic Large Room Air Purifier. This air purifier cleans up to 1100 sq. ft. every 30 minutes without filling your house with noise. In fact, the technology is twice as quiet as that of its key competitors, even on Turbo speed. Like all high-quality air purifiers, the Alen BeatheSmart has a HEP-Pure filter that claims to capture 99 percent of airborne particles down to 0.3 microns. This combines with the device\xe2\x80\x99s Laser Smart Sensor, which also detects airborne particles down to 0.3 microns, to effectively clean your air of dust, pollen, allergens and dander.</p><p>No expense is spared in the design of the air purifier, either. The Air Quality Indicator Light always reflects the real-time purity of the room\xe2\x80\x99s air in an easy-to-read display. Furthermore, it comes in 14 different colors and panels so you can always find one to match your home\xe2\x80\x99s interior. This is a high-end device,&nbsp;coming in at&nbsp;$688.</p><h2><strong>Levoit Compact Air Purifier</strong></h2>[id=8]<p>Compact enough to fit on your desk but powerful enough to remove 99.9 percent of dust, pollen, smoke, odor, mold spores and pet dander, the Levoit Compact Air Purifier is an excellent entry-level option. Rather than using a UV or ions to clean the air, the device features a three-stage filtration system. This comprises a pre-filter, a HEPA filter and an activated carbon filter. Three fan settings let you control the speed and volume of the purifier.</p><p>This air purifier was definitely designed for use in the bedroom, but you can also tuck it into the corner of your desk at work. It features a soft optional night light with two brightness settings as well as a very quiet fan. It\xe2\x80\x99s not out of place on your nightstand, with its white or black case and sleek design. While not as feature-filled as other air purifiers on this list and better suited to small rooms than large homes, you can find it on&nbsp;Amazon for the low price of $90.</p><h2><strong>Blueair Blue Pure 211+</strong></h2>[id=9]<p>If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a classy device that can move large volumes of air, then this may well be the way to go. This three-stage air purifier comes with two washable pre-filters and is perfect for filtering out particles, pet dander, smoke and so on, ensuring that your home is nice and clean. This air purifier is available in a few sizes, so if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for something for larger rooms, it\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect way to go. If, however, you need something for a smaller room, it may be worth buying one of the less expensive purifiers on this list.</p><h2><strong>Philips Smart Air Purifier</strong></h2>[id=10]<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes difficult to tell how effective an air purifier is, so&nbsp;Philips makes it simple with a light display feature that shows you the air quality in the room, ranging from blue (good) to red (poor). Philips Smart Air Purifier also offers three distinct modes: General Mode, which sets automatically; Allergen Mode, which adjusts its speed when it detects changes in allergen levels; and NightSense mode, which automatically turns down the fan speed and dims its lights when the room is dark.</p><p>This is an exceptionally popular air purifier, partly due to the fact that it comes in many sizes and prices, ranging from $250 for a bedroom fan to $549 for an extra-large room fan. The ability to control the purifier remotely is also attractive to anyone investing in smart home technology.</p><h2><strong>Honeywell True HEPA Allergen Air Purifier</strong></h2>[id=11]<p>Honeywell air purifiers have been recommended by allergists time and time again, and for good reason. This air purifier is excellent at ensuring that allergens \xe2\x80\x94 whether they be from pollen, pet dander, or anything else \xe2\x80\x94 are taken out of the air. That\xe2\x80\x99s perfect for those with allergies. The device also offers three air cleaning levels, along with a Turbo Clean setting, and it can circulate the air in a home up to a whopping five times per hour. That\xe2\x80\x99s impressive.</p><h2><strong>PARTU Air Purifier</strong></h2>[id=12]<p>The PARTU Air Purifier claims to be the quietest on the market, which is big news for anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s struggled to sleep to do a whirring, noisy fan. At its lowest speed, the PARTU creates 25db of noise; this is just above the sound of leaves rustling, which clocks in at 20db, for comparison. A fairly basic device, its most notable features are a multicolor light setting and a memory function that remembers your last chosen setting when you turn it on.</p><p>This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the most stylish air purifier of the bunch; guests will definitely know its purpose when they walk in the room. But it\xe2\x80\x99s still relatively compact at 17 inches in height, making it easy to stow away, and is the&nbsp;least expensive in-home device of the pack at $70.</p><h2><strong>Dyson Pure Cool Link Desk Air Purifier</strong></h2>[id=13]<p>Dyson has long been known as an innovator in the home cleaning space, though&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/meggentaylor/2018/06/26/dysons-latest-products-will-revolutionize-how-you-clean-your-home-and-purify-your-air/#43efabc633cd\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\" title=\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/meggentaylor/2018/06/26/dysons-latest-products-will-revolutionize-how-you-clean-your-home-and-purify-your-air/#43efabc633cd\\" style=\\"background-color: transparent;\\">its product line recently evolved</a>&nbsp;beyond vacuums to include technology like purifying fans. The Dyson Pure Cool Fans come in two sizes: a tower and a smaller desktop size. The Desk Air Purifier earns its spot on this list because it\xe2\x80\x99s significantly less expensive than its larger counterpart \xe2\x80\x94 though at $400, it\xe2\x80\x99s still an investment. We\xe2\x80\x99ve recently seen it on sale for as low as $270 on Amazon, however, so keep your eyes peeled.</p><p>Inside the fan itself is a Dyson HEPA filter, complete with a layer of activated carbon granules that capture odors and harmful toxins like paint fumes. But the real appeal of this product is its portable size. At just 25 inches tall, it fits neatly into small spaces like laundry rooms and home offices where a stand-up fan might be cumbersome.</p><h2><strong>Molekule Air Purifier</strong></h2>[id=14]<p>This is the most expensive air purifier on the list, sitting at $799, but for serious allergy-sufferers, this is as good as it gets. Unlike most other purifiers, which have HEPA filters that collect particulates from the air,&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-finds/2018/09/06/breathe-easy-with-this-high-tech-and-stylish-air-purifier/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\" title=\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-finds/2018/09/06/breathe-easy-with-this-high-tech-and-stylish-air-purifier/\\" style=\\"background-color: transparent;\\">the Molekule</a>&nbsp;actually removes indoor air pollutants and destroys them.

We\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered outbreaks of smallpox, diphtheria and other pestilences where if you got sick, there was little chance at survival. But this situation is entirely unique. In the Second World War, which required the same kind of national mobilization, the fight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happening here.

They required a special kind of sacrifice and courage. The Civil War was the great moral and physical test. The Depression and World War II tempered us in such an unbelievable way.

The most damaging lawsuit\xe2\x80\x94an invasion-of-privacy case revolving around a sex tape of the wrestler Hulk Hogan (real name, Terry Bollea)\xe2\x80\x94recently resulted in a $140 million jury award and a national debate on the rights of celebrities versus the rights of a publication to disseminate what it considers to be newsworthy.</p><p>The revelation that Thiel paid Hogan\'s lawyers\xe2\x80\x94to the tune of about $10 million\xe2\x80\x94has transformed that discussion. Gawker, supported by free-speech advocates like&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.forbes.com/companies/ebay/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\">eBay</a> founder&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/pierre-omidyar/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\">Pierre Omidyar</a>&nbsp;and Amazon CEO&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/jeff-bezos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\">Jeff Bezos</a>, has denounced Thiel\'s gambit as an attempt to permanently snuff out an unpopular media outlet through aggressive litigation. Thiel, lauded by a host of other Silicon Valley heavy hitters who have felt Gawker\'s wrath, from&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/chris-sacca/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\">Chris Sacca</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/vinod-khosla/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\">Vinod Khosla</a>, has described his efforts as \\"one of my greater philanthropic things,\\" helping those who have been wronged by a \\"singularly terrible bully.\\"</p><p>Thiel has been deliberately vague, granting just one interview\xe2\x80\x94to&nbsp;<em>The New York Times&nbsp;</em>\xe2\x80\x94and refusing to talk to FORBES about this subject. But over the past two weeks, which has included interviews with more than 50 people, FORBES has pieced together the kind of narrative that a site like Gawker used to feast on.</p><p>Rather than simply play the vigilante, available to help those who have been publicly attacked by a company even the most ardent press advocates must hold their noses to defend, Thiel secretly declared a multi-front war against Gawker, seeking to crush it by any means necessary.</p><p>Specifically, while Gawker has found itself defending&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/05/30/peter-thiel-hulk-hogan-lawyers-charles-harder/#1c62300f108e\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\">numerous Thiel-backed lawsuits</a>&nbsp;attacking its kind of journalism, there has also been an orchestrated effort to initiate a&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2850065-Hudson-Class-Complaint.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener\\">class-action labor suit</a>&nbsp;against it. Some in the Los Angeles legal community talk openly about a coordinated strategy against Gawker. And at least one Silicon Valley billionaire has quietly pursued the concept of a Gawker buyout by indirectly reaching out to former staffers.</p><p>Thiel\'s level of involvement in each of these initiatives remains opaque. What isn\'t: the impact of this attack on Gawker. The $140 million judgment, which isn\'t covered by insurance, could prove fatal to the company if it\'s upheld\xe2\x80\x94and could serve as a blueprint for any billionaire who wants to lay siege against a media outlet.</p>[id=2]<p><strong><sup class=\\"drop-cap color-accent font-accent\\">T</sup></strong>he fateful danc<strong>e</strong>&nbsp;between Thiel and Gawker can be traced back to 2002. That\'s the year Nick Denton, a former Financial Times journalist, founded Gawker. That\'s also the year Peter Thiel and his legendary \\"mafia,\\" which includes&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\">Elon Musk</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/reid-hoffman/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\">Reid Hoffman</a>, took PayPal public, giving Thiel the kind of cash to be able to shell out $500,000 for 10% of a raw startup called Facebook, and then to launch Palantir, the data-mining giant that\'s now worth some $20 billion.</p><p>But those big successes had yet to take hold with the general public when Gawker.com first made passing mention of Thiel in March 2006. More than two dozen blog posts quickly followed, before the site declared, in a Dec. 19, 2007 headline: \\"Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.\\" While some dispute whether the article actually outed the billionaire (Thiel said in past interviews that his friends had known since at least 2003), it certainly broadcast his sexuality to the rest of the world, something those close to Thiel say he was very uncomfortable with.</p><p>Over the ensuing years, Thiel\'s prominence and wealth\xe2\x80\x94FORBES estimates he\'s worth $2.7 billion\xe2\x80\x94rose in lockstep with Gawker\'s influence. The website, which had a heavy focus on media and gossip, spawned spinoffs like Deadspin (sports), Jezebel (feminism), Gizmodo (gadgets) and Valleywag (Silicon Valley). All shared the mother ship\'s formula of snarky, aggressive commentary, breaking news and click-friendly headlines. At its best, Gawker could prompt a congressman to resign (Christopher Lee did so after sending shirtless pictures to a Craigslist paramour) or synthesize the assault accusations against Bill Cosby. At its worst, it was a spiteful, bile-fueled gossip rag whose decisions of questionable newsworthiness included posting a video of a heavily intoxicated woman having sex in a public bathroom and publishing what appeared to be a clumsy attempt by a then obscure\xe2\x80\x94and married\xe2\x80\x94media executive to solicit a gay encounter.</p><p>Gawker and Valleywag made Thiel a favorite subject. He gave them lots of material: The libertarian proposed building ship-bound communities in international waters to escape national governments, including the U.S., and began funding promising teenage entrepreneurs on the explicit condition they skip college to start companies.</p><p>\\"To the extent that there are contradictions, I am much more aware of them than people whose views fit into a very standard matrix,\\" Thiel told FORBES, channeling his inner Peter Gregory, as part of a cover story in 2011.</p><p>The following October Gawker published a short video clip of Hogan having sex with his friend\'s wife, Heather Clem.

A former journalist named Phil Linsalata was e-mailing former Gawker interns at the time, saying that he was working on academic research \\"focusing on labor conditions in digital media.\\" After speaking with them on the phone, he would then send them to Harder\'s firm for what he framed as a free \\"consultation.\\"</p><p>A former Gawker intern named David Matthews even signed&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2852791-Harder-Retainer-Agreement.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener\\">a retainer agreement</a>&nbsp;with Harder Mirell. Ultimately Harder passed the interns off to a New York-based law firm specializing in labor claims, which brought a class action against Gawker in June 2013 that was dismissed and later privately settled. Matthews claims that the lawyers misrepresented their intentions and now says he feels \\"the sense of being a pawn or an item in a ledger.\\"</p><p>Harder\'s web appears to extend to a federal court in Chicago, where a plaintiff named Meanith Huon, a lawyer and former life insurance salesman, sued Gawker in 2011 for allegedly implying that he had sexually assaulted a woman he had met through Craigslist. He was later acquitted of rape but sought action against legal news blog Above the Law and Gawker-owned Jezebel for suggesting in stories that he was a serial rapist.&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2850889-Huon-court-transcription.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener\\">In a hearing</a>&nbsp;last year Huon said that he had decided to settle with the former\xe2\x80\x94but continue his crusade against Gawker in a higher court even after a judge dismissed claims of defamation. According to Steve Mandell, an attorney for Above the Law who was present at the hearing, Huon told the judge in open court that he wasn\'t worried about his appeal because he was \\"getting support from Hulk Hogan\'s lawyers in California.\\" Huon and Harder declined to comment on the case, which is now on appeal.</p><p>Harder takes issue with the idea, circulating in L.A. legal circles, that suing Gawker has become his firm\'s \\"bread and butter\\": \\"We represent numerous businesses and individuals in a plethora of legal matters that have nothing whatsoever to do with Gawker.\\"</p><p>Nor would Harder discuss the specifics of his arrangement with Thiel. \\"If a person has been wronged, he or she is entitled to be made whole. This is true whether the person pays their own legal bill, or has a law firm on contingency, or is represented by a public interest law firm, or an attorney on a pro bono case, or has someone else helping with the costs.\\"</p>[id=4]<p><strong><sup class=\\"drop-cap color-accent font-accent\\">S</sup></strong>ilicon Valley is<strong>&nbsp;</strong>circling Gawker in at least one other way. In January, following the departure of numerous executives and editors from the embattled media company, some former employees were contacted by Scott Sonnenblick, a partner at corporate M&amp;A law firm Linklaters, who said he was looking to discuss the possibility of buying the company. Sonnenblick specifically told some of these ex-employees that he was calling on behalf of at least one Silicon Valley heavyweight.</p><p>There\'s nothing unusual about making a bid by approaching former executives, who bring insiders\' knowledge and outsiders\' hunger. But having a Silicon Valley billionaire circle a private New York media company under siege from a Silicon Valley billionaire is certainly unusual. Sonnenblick and Thiel\'s camp declined to comment.</p><p>Regardless, Denton needs help. While Gawker has since been able to secure funding from Russian billionaire&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/viktor-vekselberg/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\">Viktor Vekselberg\'s</a>&nbsp;Columbus Nova Technology Partners, the company remains under attack. The $140 million verdict, while widely expected to be reduced or eliminated on appeal, hangs over Gawker\'s head like a guillotine, and numerous legal expenses are draining its resources.</p><p>During an interview with FORBES at the Code Conference in Los Angeles, Denton says that Gawker recorded revenue of $50 million last year and would have broken even absent legal fees. However, with fees, which have totaled about $10 million in the Hogan case alone, 2015 and likely 2016 will end up in the red. Gawker already initiated a small number of layoffs to reduce costs.</p><p>Gawker has changed, post-Thiel. The company has shuttered Valleywag and its celebrity rumor mill, Defamer, and Denton said last November that the Gawker flagship would refocus on politics. \\"For a long time the lawsuits seemed like karmic retribution for skating so close to the edge,\\" says a current Gawker employee. \\"But for once, Nick Denton\'s conspiracy theories turned out to be true.\\"</p><p>In an age where media assets have become a strategic hobby for non-media billionaires, whether they wear white hats (Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post) or black hats (<a href=\\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/sheldon-adelson/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\">Sheldon Adelson</a>&nbsp;and the Las Vegas Review-Journal), the idea that a media entity can be systematically sued into submission by an aggrieved subject is an ugly long-term prospect.</p><p>In the short term, Denton is doing what he needs to do to survive. After sitting down with FORBES at the Code conference, Denton scurries off to his next meeting, garnering sympathetic greetings as he walks to the lobby of a five-star oceanfront resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. He\'s more than ten minutes late by the time he arrives. He quickly extends his hand to Sameer Deen, the senior vice president for digital at Univision\xe2\x80\x94a company reportedly interested in investing in Gawker, headaches and all.</p><p><em>Follow Ryan on Twitter at&nbsp;</em><a href=\\"https://twitter.com/rmac18\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener\\"><em>@RMac18</em></a><em>&nbsp;or email him at rmac@forbes.com.

More than two dozen blog posts quickly followed, before the site declared, in a Dec. 19, 2007 headline: \\\\\\"Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.\\\\\\" While some dispute whether the article actually outed the billionaire (Thiel said in past interviews that his friends had known since at least 2003), it certainly broadcast his sexuality to the rest of the world, something those close to Thiel say he was very uncomfortable with.\\\\nOver the ensuing years, Thiel\'s prominence and wealth\xe2\x80\x94FORBES estimates he\'s worth $2.7 billion\xe2\x80\x94rose in lockstep with Gawker\'s influence. The website, which had a heavy focus on media and gossip, spawned spinoffs like Deadspin (sports), Jezebel (feminism), Gizmodo (gadgets) and Valleywag (Silicon Valley). All shared the mother ship\'s formula of snarky, aggressive commentary, breaking news and click-friendly headlines. At its best, Gawker could prompt a congressman to resign (Christopher Lee did so after sending shirtless pictures to a Craigslist paramour) or synthesize the assault accusations against Bill Cosby. At its worst, it was a spiteful, bile-fueled gossip rag whose decisions of questionable newsworthiness included posting a video of a heavily intoxicated woman having sex in a public bathroom and publishing what appeared to be a clumsy attempt by a then obscure\xe2\x80\x94and married\xe2\x80\x94media executive to solicit a gay encounter.\\\\nGawker and Valleywag made Thiel a favorite subject. He gave them lots of material: The libertarian proposed building ship-bound communities in international waters to escape national governments, including the U.S., and began funding promising teenage entrepreneurs on the explicit condition they skip college to start companies.\\\\n\\\\\\"To the extent that there are contradictions, I am much more aware of them than people whose views fit into a very standard matrix,\\\\\\" Thiel told FORBES, channeling his inner Peter Gregory, as part of a cover story in 2011.\\\\nThe following October Gawker published a short video clip of Hogan having sex with his friend\'s wife, Heather Clem.

In January, following the departure of numerous executives and editors from the embattled media company, some former employees were contacted by Scott Sonnenblick, a partner at corporate M&A law firm Linklaters, who said he was looking to discuss the possibility of buying the company. Sonnenblick specifically told some of these ex-employees that he was calling on behalf of at least one Silicon Valley heavyweight.\\\\nThere\'s nothing unusual about making a bid by approaching former executives, who bring insiders\' knowledge and outsiders\' hunger. But having a Silicon Valley billionaire circle a private New York media company under siege from a Silicon Valley billionaire is certainly unusual.

However, with fees, which have totaled about $10 million in the Hogan case alone, 2015 and likely 2016 will end up in the red. Gawker already initiated a small number of layoffs to reduce costs.\\\\nGawker has changed, post-Thiel. The company has shuttered Valleywag and its celebrity rumor mill, Defamer, and Denton said last November that the Gawker flagship would refocus on politics. \\\\\\"For a long time the lawsuits seemed like karmic retribution for skating so close to the edge,\\\\\\" says a current Gawker employee. \\\\\\"But for once, Nick Denton\'s conspiracy theories turned out to be true.\\\\\\"\\\\nIn an age where media assets have become a strategic hobby for non-media billionaires, whether they wear white hats (Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post) or black hats (\\"},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"color\\":\\"\\",\\"link\\":\\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/sheldon-adelson/\\"},\\"insert\\":\\"Sheldon Adelson\\"},{\\"insert\\":\\"\xc2\xa0and the Las Vegas Review-Journal), the idea that a media entity can be systematically sued into submission by an aggrieved subject is an ugly long-term prospect.\\\\nIn the short term, Denton is doing what he needs to do to survive.

Over the next few days, Jared Kushner sat down with <em>Forbes</em> and discussed his role in the Trump campaign for the first time, revealing the secret data operation run with Brad Parscale that proved the difference-maker. It\xe2\x80\x99s a story that been cited constantly over the past four years\xe2\x80\x93the Cambridge Analytica profiling, the gaming of Facebook and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to influence the election all started with Kushner\xe2\x80\x99s revelations regarding his war room.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x94 Randall Lane, Chief Content Officer</p>[id=49]<p><strong><em>Originally published Nov. 22, 2016</em></strong></p><p><sup class=\\"drop-cap color-accent font-accent\\">I</sup>t\'s been one week since Donald Trump pulled off the biggest upset in modern political history, and his headquarters at Trump Tower in New York City is a 58-story, onyx-glassed lightning rod. Barricades, TV trucks and protesters frame a fortified Fifth Avenue. Armies of journalists and selfie-seeking tourists stalk Trump Tower\'s pink marble lobby, hoping to snap the next political power player who steps into view. Twenty-six floors up, in the same building where washed-up celebrities once battled for Trump\'s blessing on The Apprentice, the president-elect is choosing his Cabinet, and this contest contains all the twists and turns of his old reality show.</p>[id=32]<p>Winners will emerge shortly. But today\'s focus is on the biggest loser: New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who has just been fired from his role leading the transition, along with most of the people associated with him. The episode is being characterized as a \\"knife fight\\" that ends in a \\"Stalinesque purge.\\"</p><p>The most compelling figure in this intrigue, however, wasn\'t in Trump Tower. Jared Kushner was three blocks south, high up in his own skyscraper, at 666 Fifth Avenue, where he oversees his family\'s Kushner Companies real estate empire. Trump\'s son-in-law, dressed in an impeccably tailored gray suit, sitting on a brown leather couch in his impeccably neat office, displays the impeccably polite manners that won the 35-year-old a dizzying number of influential friends even before he had gained the ear, and trust, of the new leader of the free world.</p><p>\\"Six months ago Governor Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together,\\" he says with a shrug. \\"The media has speculated on a lot of different things, and since I don\'t talk to the press, they go as they go, but I was not behind pushing out him or his people.\\"</p><p>The speculation was well-founded, given the story\'s Shakespearean twist: As a U.S. attorney in 2005, Christie jailed Kushner\'s father on tax evasion, election fraud and witness tampering charges. Revenge theories aside, the buzz around Kushner was directional and indicative. A year ago he had zero experience in politics and about as much interest in it. Suddenly he sits at its global center. Whether he plunged the dagger into Christie\xe2\x80\x94Trump insiders insist the Bridgegate scandal did him in\xe2\x80\x94is less important than the fact that he easily could have. And that power comes well-earned.</p><p>Kushner almost never speaks publicly\xe2\x80\x94his chats with FORBES mark the first time he has talked about the Trump campaign or his role in it\xe2\x80\x94but interviews with him and a dozen people around him and the Trump camp lead to an inescapable fact: The quiet, enigmatic young mogul delivered the presidency to the most fame-hungry, bombastic candidate in American history.</p><p>\\"It\'s hard to overstate and hard to summarize Jared\'s role in the campaign,\\" says billionaire Peter Thiel, the only significant Silicon Valley figure to publicly back Trump. \\"If Trump was the CEO, Jared was effectively the chief operating officer.\\"</p><p>\\"Jared Kushner is the biggest surprise of the 2016 election,\\" adds Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, who helped design the Clinton campaign\'s technology system. \\"Best I can tell, he actually ran the campaign and did it with essentially no resources.\\"</p>[id=34]<h3 class=\\"subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent\\">VIDEO |<strong> President Trump: What The First 100 Days Might Look Like</strong></h3>[id=33][id=35]<p>No resources at the beginning, perhaps. Underfunded throughout, for sure. But by running the Trump campaign\xe2\x80\x94notably, its secret data operation\xe2\x80\x94like a Silicon Valley startup, Kushner eventually tipped the states that swung the election. And he did so in manner that will change the way future elections will be won and lost. President Obama had unprecedented success in targeting, organizing and motivating voters. But a lot has changed in eight years. Specifically social media. Clinton did borrow from Obama\'s playbook but also leaned on traditional media. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, delved into message tailoring, sentiment manipulation and machine learning. The traditional campaign is dead, another victim of the unfiltered democracy of the Web\xe2\x80\x94and Kushner, more than anyone not named Donald Trump, killed it.</p><p>That achievement, coupled with the personal trust Trump has in him, uniquely positions Kushner to be a power broker of the highest order for at least four years. \\"Every president I\'ve ever known has one or two people he intuitively and structurally trusts,\\" says former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who has known Trump socially for decades and is currently advising the president-elect on foreign policy issues. \\"I think Jared might be that person.\\"</p>[id=44]<p><strong><sup class=\\"drop-cap color-accent font-accent\\">J</sup>ARED KUSHNER\'S ASCENT</strong>&nbsp;from Ivanka Trump\'s little-known husband to Donald Trump\'s campaign savior happened gradually. In the early days of the scrappy campaign, it was all hands on deck, with Kushner helping research policy positions on tax and trade. But as the campaign gained steam, other players began using him as a trusted conduit to an erratic candidate. \\"I helped facilitate a lot of relationships that wouldn\'t have happened otherwise,\\" Kushner says, adding that people felt safe speaking with him, without risk of leaks. \\"People were being told in Washington that if they did any work for the Trump campaign, they would never be able to work in Republican politics again. I hired a great tax-policy expert who joined under two conditions: We couldn\'t tell anybody he worked for the campaign, and he was going to charge us double.\\"</p><p>Kushner\'s role expanded as the Trump ticket gained traction\xe2\x80\x94so did his enthusiasm. Kushner went all-in with Trump last November after seeing his father-in-law pack a raucous arena in Springfield, Illinois, on a Monday night. \\"People really saw hope in his message,\\" he says. \\"They wanted the things that wouldn\'t have been obvious to a lot of people I would meet in the New York media world, the Upper East Side or at Robin Hood &lsqb;Foundation&rsqb; dinners.\\" And so this Harvard-educated child of privilege put on a bright-red Make American Great Again hat and rolled up his sleeves.</p><p>A power vacuum awaited him at Trump Tower. When FORBES visited the Trump campaign floor in the skyscraper a few weeks before Kushner\'s Springfield epiphany, there was literally nothing there. No people\xe2\x80\x94and no desks or chairs or computers awaiting the arrival of staffers. Just campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, spokesperson Hope Hicks and a strategy that centered on Trump making headline-grabbing statements, often by calling in to television shows, supplemented by a rally once or twice a week to provide the appearance of a traditional campaign. It was the epitome of the super-light startup: to see how little they could spend and still get the results they wanted.</p><p>Kushner stepped up to turn it into an actual campaign operation. Soon he was assembling a speech and policy team, handling Trump\'s schedule and managing the finances. \\"Donald kept saying, \'I don\'t want people getting rich off the campaign, and I want to make sure we are watching every dollar just like we would do in business.\'\\"</p><p>That structure provided a baseline, though still a blip compared with Hillary Clinton\'s state-by-state machine. The decision that won Trump the presidency started on the return trip from that Springfield rally last November aboard his private 757, dubbed Trump Force One. Chatting over McDonald\'s Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, Trump and Kushner talked about how the campaign was underutilizing social media. The candidate, in turn, asked his son-in-law to take over his Facebook initiatives.</p><p>Despite his itchy Twitter finger, Trump is a Luddite. He reportedly gets his news from print and television, and his version of e-mail is to handwrite a note that his assistant will scan and attach. Among those in his close circle, Kushner was the natural pick to create a modern campaign. Yes, like Trump he\'s primarily a real estate guy, but he had invested more broadly, including in media (in 2006 he bought the New York Observer) and digital commerce (he helped launch Cadre, an online marketplace for big real estate deals). More important, he knew the right crowd: co-investors in Cadre include Thiel and Alibaba\'s Jack Ma\xe2\x80\x94and Kushner\'s younger brother, Josh, a formidable venture capitalist who also cofounded the $2.7 billion insurance unicorn Oscar Health.</p>[id=36][id=24][id=37]<p>\\"I called some of my friends from Silicon Valley, some of the best digital marketers in the world, and asked how you scale this stuff,\\" Kushner says. \\"They gave me their subcontractors.\\"</p><p>At first Kushner dabbled, engaging in what amounted to a beta test using Trump merchandise. \\"I called somebody who works for one of the technology companies that I work with, and I had them give me a tutorial on how to use Facebook micro-targeting,\\" Kushner says. Synched with Trump\'s blunt, simple messaging, it worked. The Trump campaign went from selling $8,000 worth of hats and other items a day to $80,000, generating revenue, expanding the number of human billboards\xe2\x80\x94and proving a concept. In another test, Kushner spent $160,000 to promote a series of low-tech policy videos of Trump talking straight into the camera that collectively generated more than 74 million views.</p><p>By June the GOP nomination secured, Kushner took over all data-driven efforts. Within three weeks, in a nondescript building outside San Antonio, he had built what would become a 100-person data hub designed to unify fundraising, messaging and targeting. Run by Brad Parscale, who had previously built small websites for the Trump Organization, this secret back office would drive every strategic decision during the final months of the campaign. \\"Our best people were mostly the ones who volunteered for me pro bono,\\" Kushner says. \\"People from the business world, people from nontraditional backgrounds.\\"</p><p>Kushner structured the operation with a focus on maximizing the return for every dollar spent. \\"We played Moneyball, asking ourselves which states will get the best ROI for the electoral vote,\\" Kushner says. \\"I asked, How can we get Trump\'s message to that consumer for the least amount of cost?\\" FEC filings through mid-October indicate the Trump campaign spent roughly half as much as the Clinton campaign did.</p>[id=38][id=25][id=39]<p>Just as Trump\'s unorthodox style allowed him to win the Republican nomination while spending far less than his more traditional opponents, Kushner\'s lack of political experience became an advantage. Unschooled in traditional campaigning, he was able to look at the business of politics the way so many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have sized up other bloated industries.</p><p>Television and online advertising? Small and smaller. Twitter and Facebook would fuel the campaign, as key tools for not only spreading Trump\'s message but also targeting potential supporters, scraping massive amounts of constituent data and sensing shifts in sentiment in real time.</p><p>\\"We weren\'t afraid to make changes. We weren\'t afraid to fail. We tried to do things very cheaply, very quickly. And if it wasn\'t working, we would kill it quickly,\\" Kushner says. \\"It meant making quick decisions, fixing things that were broken and scaling things that worked.\\"</p><p>This wasn\'t a completely raw startup. Kushner\'s crew was able to tap into the Republican National Committee\'s data machine, and it hired targeting partners like Cambridge Analytica to map voter universes and identify which parts of the Trump platform mattered most: trade, immigration or change. Tools like Deep Root drove the scaled-back TV ad spending by identifying shows popular with specific voter blocks in specific regions\xe2\x80\x94say, NCIS for anti-ObamaCare voters or The Walking Dead for people worried about immigration. Kushner built a custom geo-location tool that plotted the location density of about 20 voter types over a live Google Maps interface.</p><p>Soon the data operation dictated every campaign decision: travel, fundraising, advertising, rally locations\xe2\x80\x94even the topics of the speeches. \\"He put all the different pieces together,\\" Parscale says. \\"And what\'s funny is the outside world was so obsessed about this little piece or that, they didn\'t pick up that it was all being orchestrated so well.\\"</p><p>For fundraising they turned to machine learning, installing digital marketing companies on a trading floor to make them compete for business. Ineffective ads were killed in minutes, while successful ones scaled. The campaign was sending more than 100,000 uniquely tweaked ads to targeted voters each day. In the end, the richest person ever elected president, whose fundraising effort was rightly ridiculed at the beginning of the year, raised more than $250 million in four months\xe2\x80\x94mostly from small donors.</p><p>As the election barreled toward its finale, Kushner\'s system, with its high margins and up-to-the-minute voter data, provided both ample cash and the insight on where to spend it. When the campaign registered the fact that momentum in Michigan and Pennsylvania was turning Trump\'s way, Kushner unleashed tailored TV ads, last-minute rallies and thousands of volunteers to knock on doors and make phone calls.</p><p>And until the final days of the campaign, he did all this without anyone on the outside knowing about it. For those who can\'t understand how Hillary Clinton could win the popular vote by at least 2 million yet lose handily in the electoral college, perhaps this provides some clarity. If the campaign\'s overarching sentiment was fear and anger, the deciding factor at the end was data and entrepreneurship.</p><p>\\"Jared understood the online world in a way the traditional media folks didn\'t. He managed to assemble a presidential campaign on a shoestring using new technology and won. That\'s a big deal,\\" says Schmidt, the Google billionaire. \\"Remember all those articles about how they had no money, no people, organizational structure? Well, they won, and Jared ran it.\\"</p>[id=45]<p><strong><sup class=\\"drop-cap color-accent font-accent\\">C</sup>ONTROLLED, UNDERSTATED</strong>&nbsp;and calm, Jared Kushner couldn\'t be more different from his father-in-law in personality and style. Take Twitter. While Trump\'s impulsive tweeting to his 15.5 million followers reportedly forced his staff to withhold his phone during parts of the campaign, Kushner\xe2\x80\x94who has had a verified account since April 2009\xe2\x80\x94has never posted a single tweet.</p><p>And whereas Trump\'s office is wall-to-wall Donald, a memorabilia-stuffed shrine to ego, the headquarters for the Kushner Companies is sparse and sober. A leather-bound copy of Jewish teachings, the Pirkei Avot, sits on a wooden pedestal in the reception room, and identical silver mezuzahs adorn the side of each office door. The only decoration in his large, terraced boardroom is an oil painting of his grandparents, Holocaust survivors who immigrated to the U.S. after World War II. But enter Kushner\'s corner office and you see\xe2\x80\x94under a painting with the words \\"Don\'t Panic\\" over a canvas of New York Observer pages\xe2\x80\x94two critical commonalities that unite the pair: columns of real estate deal trophies and framed photos of Ivanka. If you are looking for a consistent ideology from either Kushner or Trump, it can be summarized in a word: family.</p>[id=40]<p>Jared and Ivanka met at a business lunch and started dating in 2007. During the courtship Kushner had met Donald only a few times in passing when, sensing the relationship was getting serious, he asked Trump for a meeting. Over lunch at the Trump Grill (which Trump briefly made a household name with his infamous taco bowl tweet), they discussed the couple\'s future. \\"I said, \'Ivanka and I are getting serious, and we\'re starting to go down that path,\'\\" Kushner says and laughs.</p><p>\\"He said, \'You\'d better be serious on this.\'\\"</p><p>\\"Jared and my father initially bonded over a combination of me and real estate,\\" Ivanka Trump says in her Trump Tower offices as dark-suited Secret Service agents stand watch in the halls. \\"There\'s a lot of parallels between Jared as a developer and my father in the early years of his development career.\\"</p><p>Like Trump, Kushner grew up outside Manhattan: New Jersey in Kushner\'s case, versus Trump\'s Queens. Also like Trump, Kushner is the son of a man who created a real estate empire in his local market\xe2\x80\x94Charles Kushner eventually controlled 25,000 apartments across the Northeast\xe2\x80\x94and steeped his children in the family business. \\"My father never really believed in summer camp, so we\'d come with him to the office,\\" Kushner says. \\"We\'d go look at jobs, work on construction sites. It taught us real work.\\" Raised with three siblings in an observant Jewish home in Livingston, New Jersey, Kushner went to a private Jewish high school and then to Harvard (a 2006 book about college admissions would later single out Kushner as a prime example of how children of wealthy donors&nbsp;get preferential treatment; administrators quoted within that work later challenged its accuracy, calling it \\"distorted\\" and \\"false\\"). Next came New York University, for a joint J.D. and M.B.A.</p><p>His father was a huge supporter of Democrats, giving $1 million to the Democratic National Committee in 2002 and $90,000 to Hillary Clinton\'s Senate run in 2000, and Jared largely followed suit, with more than $60,000 to Democratic committees and $11,000 to Clinton. During grad school Kushner interned for Manhattan\'s longtime district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, before a family scandal upended his life. In 2004 Charles Kushner pleaded guilty to tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness tampering. The latter charge brought national tabloid attention. Angry that his brother-in-law was talking to prosecutors, Charles had paid a prostitute to entrap him\xe2\x80\x94a tryst that he secretly taped and then mailed to his sister.</p><p>Just 24, Jared, as the elder son, suddenly found himself charged with keeping the family together. He saw his mother most days and flew to Alabama to visit his father in prison on most weekends. He also developed a deeper bond with his brother, Josh, who had just started Harvard when the scandal broke. Says Josh, who considers Jared his best friend: \\"He is the person that I turn to for guidance and support no matter the circumstance.\\"</p><p>\\"The whole thing taught me not to worry about the things you can\'t control,\\" Kushner says. \\"You can control how you react and can try to make things happen as you want them to. I focus on doing my best to ensure the outcomes. And when it doesn\'t go my way I have to work harder the next time.\\"</p><p>That applied to the family business, too, which Kushner now led. To start fresh, he took aim at Manhattan, just as Trump did 40 years before, determined to play in America\'s most lucrative and competitive real estate market.</p><p>The timing couldn\'t have been worse. His first big purchase as CEO of the Kushner Companies, 666 Fifth, for a record-breaking $1.8 billion, closed in 2007\xe2\x80\x94just in time for the financial crisis. Rents fell, leases broke, funding vanished. To stay solvent, Kushner sold 49% of the building\'s retail space to the Carlyle Group and others for $525 million and seemingly restructured every loan agreement possible, showing a willingness to pay more down the road for room to breathe in the short term. In the end he avoided the kind of bankruptcy maneuvers that Trump pulled in the 1990s and weathered the storm.</p><p>Kushner had learned a lesson. Rather than chase top-dollar, blue-chip addresses around New York, he would try to ride up with cooler, up-and-coming neighborhoods, which he has done to the tune of $14 billion worth of acquisitions and developments, in places like Manhattan\'s SoHo and East Village and Brooklyn\'s Dumbo. \\"Jared brings a youthful perspective, an innovative mind-set, to a very traditional industry that\'s comprised of predominantly 70-year-old men,\\" Ivanka Trump says. He has also pushed into resurgent areas\xe2\x80\x94Astoria, Queens, and Journal Square in Jersey City\xe2\x80\x94that were once the stomping grounds of Fred Trump and Charles Kushner, respectively.</p>[id=46]<p><strong><sup class=\\"drop-cap color-accent font-accent\\">P</sup>ART OF THE REASON</strong>&nbsp;Jared Kushner has engendered such public interest, besides the power he suddenly wields and the curiosity generated by his near-invisible media presence, is the paradoxes that he represents.</p><p>He brought the Silicon Valley ethos, which values openness and inclusiveness, to a campaign that promised closed borders, trade protection and religious exclusion. He is the scion of prodigious Democratic donors yet steered a Republican presidential campaign. A grandson of Holocaust survivors who serves a man who has advocated a ban on war refugees. A fact-driven lawyer whose chosen candidate called global warming a hoax, linked vaccines to autism and challenged President Obama\'s citizenship. A media mogul in a campaign stoked by fake news.

A faith that, ironically, given his role in the campaign, he defends with the \\"data\\" he\'s accumulated about the man over a decade-plus relationship.</p>[id=41]<h3 class=\\"subhead3-embed color-body bg-base font-accent\\">GALLERY | <a href=\\"https://www.forbes.com/pictures/56d9b323e4b0c144a7f6ba5b/donald-trump-through-the-/#7ce556276e7e\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"color-link\\"><strong>Donald Trump: Through The Years</strong></a></h3>[id=43][id=42]<p>\\"If I know somebody and everyone else says that this person\'s a terrible person,\\" he says, \\"I\'m not going to start thinking that this person\'s a terrible person or disassociating myself, when my empirical data and experience is a lot more informed than many of the people casting these judgments. What would that say about me if I changed my view based on what other people think, as opposed to the facts that I actually know for myself?\\"</p><p>Regarding Trump\'s worldview: \\"I don\'t think it\'s very controversial in an election to become the president of the United States to say that your position is to put America first and to be nationalist as opposed to a globalist.\\"</p><p>As for Trump\'s endless stream of statements that insulted and threatened Muslims, Mexicans, women, prisoners of war and U.S. generals, among others? \\"I just know a lot of the things that people try to attack him with are just not true or overblown or exaggerations. I know his character. I know who he is, and I obviously would not have supported him if I thought otherwise. If the country gives him a chance, they\'ll find he won\'t tolerate hateful rhetoric or behavior.\\"</p><p>On his political affiliation, he defines himself thus: \\"To be determined. I haven\'t made a decision. Things are still evolving as they go.\\" He adds: \\"There\'s some aspects of the Democrat Party that didn\'t speak to me, and there are some aspects of the Republican Party that didn\'t speak to me. People in the political world try to put you into different buckets based on what exists. I think Trump\'s creating his own bucket\xe2\x80\x94a blend of what works and eliminating what doesn\'t work.\\" (Though in using the GOP-favored pejorative \\"Democrat Party\\" over the traditional \\"Democratic Party,\\" Kushner gives a hint about the contents of his bucket.)</p><p>The allegations of anti-Semitism hit closer to home. In July, Trump tweeted a graphic of Hillary Clinton against a background of dollar bills and a six-pointed star that contained the words \\"most corrupt candidate ever,\\" an image that had allegedly originated on a white supremacist message board. Dana Schwartz, a reporter for Kushner\'s Observer, wrote a widely read piece for the paper\'s site urging her boss, given the prominence he places on his faith and family, to denounce the tweet. Kushner responded with an opinion piece that defended Trump using the same old line: that he knows Trump. \\"If even the slightest infraction against what the speech police have deemed correct speech is instantly shouted down with taunts of \'racist,\' then what is left to condemn the actual racists?\\"</p><p>Kushner insists today that there will be no hate element in the Trump Administration, starting at the top. \\"You can\'t not be a racist for 69 years, then all of a sudden become a racist, right?\\" he says. \\"You can\'t not be an anti-Semite for 69 years and all of a sudden become an anti-Semite because you\'re running.\\"</p><p>His reaction to fringe elements, like the KKK and the white nationalist alt-right, who have embraced Trump? \\"Trump has disavowed their support 25 times. He\'s renounced hatred, he\'s renounced bigotry, and he\'s renounced racism. I don\'t know if he could ever denounce them enough for some people.\\" He then paraphrases a quote he attributes to Ronald Reagan: \\"Just because they support me doesn\'t mean that I support them.\\"</p><p>Kushner\'s support extends to Steve Bannon, Trump\'s strategic advisor, who had been accused by his ex-wife of making anti-Semitic comments (he denies it) and whose website, Breitbart, has often published articles that dog-whistle racist, anti-Semitic sentiments. \\"Do you hold me accountable for every single thing that the Observer\' s ever written, like they came from me?\\" Kushner says. \\"All I know about Steve is my experience working with him. He\'s an incredible Zionist and loves Israel. He was one of the leaders in the anti-divestiture campaign. And what I\'ve seen from working together with him was somebody who did not fit the description that people are pushing on him. I choose to judge him based on my experience and seeing the job he\'s done, as opposed to what other people are saying about him.\\"</p><p>And that seems to reflect how Kushner feels about friends upset by his role in electing someone who offends their values, to the point where, before the election, several wrote to him in fits of pique. \\"I call it an exfoliation. Anyone who was willing to change a friendship or not do business because of who somebody supports in politics is not somebody who has a lot of character.</p><p>\\"People are very fickle,\\" he adds. \\"You have to find what you believe in, challenge your truths. And if you believe in something, even if it\'s unpopular, you have to push with it.\\"</p>[id=47]<p><strong><sup class=\\"drop-cap color-accent font-accent\\">M</sup>ANY OF THOSE&nbsp;</strong>fickle friends are likely to return now that Kushner, after masterminding Trump\'s stunning victory, has the ear of the future president. What he will do with that power is anyone\'s guess.</p><p>For now, Kushner plays coy: \\"There\'s a lot of people who have been asking me to get involved in a more official capacity. I just have to think about what that means for my family, for my business and make sure it\'d be the right thing for a multitude of reasons.\\"</p><p>It\'s unlikely that he can hold a formal position in the Trump White House. Nepotism laws established after President Kennedy made brother Bobby attorney general bar the president from giving government roles to relatives\xe2\x80\x94including in-laws. Reports have stated that the administration is exploring every legal angle to get Kushner into the West Wing\xe2\x80\x94including adding him as an unpaid advisor, though even that may be covered by the law, which was written to ensure fealty to the Constitution rather than the individual.</p><p>But it may be a moot point. With or without a government title or a $170,000 federal salary, there\'s no law that bans a president from seeking counsel from whomever he wants. It\'s clear America\'s tech and entrepreneurial leaders, who heavily backed Clinton and collectively denounced Trump, will use Kushner as a go-between and that Trump will lean on him just as heavily.</p><p>\\"I assume he\'ll be in the White House throughout the entire presidency,\\" says News Corp. billionaire Rupert Murdoch. \\"For the next four or eight years he\'ll be a strong voice, maybe even the strongest after the vice president.\\"</p>","bodyAsDeltas":"[{\\"attributes\\":{\\"italic\\":true,\\"bold\\":true},\\"insert\\":\\"As this decade ends, we\xe2\x80\x99re republishing our best work from the past 10 years, a journey that reflects \\"},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"bold\\":true},\\"insert\\":\\"Forbes\xe2\x80\x99\\"},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"italic\\":true,\\"bold\\":true},\\"insert\\":\\" two-fold mission: chronicle entrepreneurial capitalism\xe2\x80\x94shinning a light on the disruptors changing the world forever\xe2\x80\x94and call out the rogues abusing the system. \\"},{\\"insert\\":\\"\\\\nAfter Donald Trump shocked the world on Election Day, there was a land grab for credit.

Armies of journalists and selfie-seeking tourists stalk Trump Tower\'s pink marble lobby, hoping to snap the next political power player who steps into view. Twenty-six floors up, in the same building where washed-up celebrities once battled for Trump\'s blessing on The Apprentice, the president-elect is choosing his Cabinet, and this contest contains all the twists and turns of his old reality show.\\\\n\\"},{\\"insert\\":{\\"ad\\":\\"32\\"}},{\\"insert\\":\\"Winners will emerge shortly.

The episode is being characterized as a \\\\\\"knife fight\\\\\\" that ends in a \\\\\\"Stalinesque purge.\\\\\\"\\\\nThe most compelling figure in this intrigue, however, wasn\'t in Trump Tower. Jared Kushner was three blocks south, high up in his own skyscraper, at 666 Fifth Avenue, where he oversees his family\'s Kushner Companies real estate empire. Trump\'s son-in-law, dressed in an impeccably tailored gray suit, sitting on a brown leather couch in his impeccably neat office, displays the impeccably polite manners that won the 35-year-old a dizzying number of influential friends even before he had gained the ear, and trust, of the new leader of the free world.\\\\n\\\\\\"Six months ago Governor Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together,\\\\\\" he says with a shrug. \\\\\\"The media has speculated on a lot of different things, and since I don\'t talk to the press, they go as they go, but I was not behind pushing out him or his people.\\\\\\"\\\\nThe speculation was well-founded, given the story\'s Shakespearean twist: As a U.S. attorney in 2005, Christie jailed Kushner\'s father on tax evasion, election fraud and witness tampering charges. Revenge theories aside, the buzz around Kushner was directional and indicative. A year ago he had zero experience in politics and about as much interest in it. Suddenly he sits at its global center. Whether he plunged the dagger into Christie\xe2\x80\x94Trump insiders insist the Bridgegate scandal did him in\xe2\x80\x94is less important than the fact that he easily could have. And that power comes well-earned.\\\\nKushner almost never speaks publicly\xe2\x80\x94his chats with FORBES mark the first time he has talked about the Trump campaign or his role in it\xe2\x80\x94but interviews with him and a dozen people around him and the Trump camp lead to an inescapable fact: The quiet, enigmatic young mogul delivered the presidency to the most fame-hungry, bombastic candidate in American history.\\\\n\\\\\\"It\'s hard to overstate and hard to summarize Jared\'s role in the campaign,\\\\\\" says billionaire Peter Thiel, the only significant Silicon Valley figure to publicly back Trump. \\\\\\"If Trump was the CEO, Jared was effectively the chief operating officer.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\\"Jared Kushner is the biggest surprise of the 2016 election,\\\\\\" adds Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, who helped design the Clinton campaign\'s technology system. \\\\\\"Best I can tell, he actually ran the campaign and did it with essentially no resources.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\"},{\\"insert\\":{\\"rule\\":\\"34\\"}},{\\"insert\\":\\"VIDEO |\\"},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"bold\\":true},\\"insert\\":\\" President Trump: What The First 100 Days Might Look Like\\"},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"color\\":\\"\\",\\"font\\":\\"\\",\\"header\\":3},\\"insert\\":\\"\\\\n\\"},{\\"insert\\":{\\"brightcove\\":\\"33\\"}},{\\"insert\\":{\\"rule\\":\\"35\\"}},{\\"insert\\":\\"No resources at the beginning, perhaps. Underfunded throughout, for sure. But by running the Trump campaign\xe2\x80\x94notably, its secret data operation\xe2\x80\x94like a Silicon Valley startup, Kushner eventually tipped the states that swung the election. And he did so in manner that will change the way future elections will be won and lost. President Obama had unprecedented success in targeting, organizing and motivating voters. But a lot has changed in eight years. Specifically social media. Clinton did borrow from Obama\'s playbook but also leaned on traditional media. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, delved into message tailoring, sentiment manipulation and machine learning. The traditional campaign is dead, another victim of the unfiltered democracy of the Web\xe2\x80\x94and Kushner, more than anyone not named Donald Trump, killed it.\\\\nThat achievement, coupled with the personal trust Trump has in him, uniquely positions Kushner to be a power broker of the highest order for at least four years. \\\\\\"Every president I\'ve ever known has one or two people he intuitively and structurally trusts,\\\\\\" says former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who has known Trump socially for decades and is currently advising the president-elect on foreign policy issues. \\\\\\"I think Jared might be that person.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\"},{\\"insert\\":{\\"ad\\":\\"44\\"}},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"drop-cap\\":true,\\"bold\\":true},\\"insert\\":\\"J\\"},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"bold\\":true},\\"insert\\":\\"ARED KUSHNER\'S ASCENT\\"},{\\"insert\\":\\"\xc2\xa0from Ivanka Trump\'s little-known husband to Donald Trump\'s campaign savior happened gradually. In the early days of the scrappy campaign, it was all hands on deck, with Kushner helping research policy positions on tax and trade. But as the campaign gained steam, other players began using him as a trusted conduit to an erratic candidate. \\\\\\"I helped facilitate a lot of relationships that wouldn\'t have happened otherwise,\\\\\\" Kushner says, adding that people felt safe speaking with him, without risk of leaks. \\\\\\"People were being told in Washington that if they did any work for the Trump campaign, they would never be able to work in Republican politics again. I hired a great tax-policy expert who joined under two conditions: We couldn\'t tell anybody he worked for the campaign, and he was going to charge us double.\\\\\\"\\\\nKushner\'s role expanded as the Trump ticket gained traction\xe2\x80\x94so did his enthusiasm. Kushner went all-in with Trump last November after seeing his father-in-law pack a raucous arena in Springfield, Illinois, on a Monday night. \\\\\\"People really saw hope in his message,\\\\\\" he says. \\\\\\"They wanted the things that wouldn\'t have been obvious to a lot of people I would meet in the New York media world, the Upper East Side or at Robin Hood [Foundation] dinners.\\\\\\" And so this Harvard-educated child of privilege put on a bright-red Make American Great Again hat and rolled up his sleeves.\\\\nA power vacuum awaited him at Trump Tower. When FORBES visited the Trump campaign floor in the skyscraper a few weeks before Kushner\'s Springfield epiphany, there was literally nothing there. No people\xe2\x80\x94and no desks or chairs or computers awaiting the arrival of staffers. Just campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, spokesperson Hope Hicks and a strategy that centered on Trump making headline-grabbing statements, often by calling in to television shows, supplemented by a rally once or twice a week to provide the appearance of a traditional campaign. It was the epitome of the super-light startup: to see how little they could spend and still get the results they wanted.\\\\nKushner stepped up to turn it into an actual campaign operation. Soon he was assembling a speech and policy team, handling Trump\'s schedule and managing the finances. \\\\\\"Donald kept saying, \'I don\'t want people getting rich off the campaign, and I want to make sure we are watching every dollar just like we would do in business.\'\\\\\\"\\\\nThat structure provided a baseline, though still a blip compared with Hillary Clinton\'s state-by-state machine. The decision that won Trump the presidency started on the return trip from that Springfield rally last November aboard his private 757, dubbed Trump Force One. Chatting over McDonald\'s Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, Trump and Kushner talked about how the campaign was underutilizing social media. The candidate, in turn, asked his son-in-law to take over his Facebook initiatives.\\\\nDespite his itchy Twitter finger, Trump is a Luddite. He reportedly gets his news from print and television, and his version of e-mail is to handwrite a note that his assistant will scan and attach. Among those in his close circle, Kushner was the natural pick to create a modern campaign. Yes, like Trump he\'s primarily a real estate guy, but he had invested more broadly, including in media (in 2006 he bought the New York Observer) and digital commerce (he helped launch Cadre, an online marketplace for big real estate deals). More important, he knew the right crowd: co-investors in Cadre include Thiel and Alibaba\'s Jack Ma\xe2\x80\x94and Kushner\'s younger brother, Josh, a formidable venture capitalist who also cofounded the $2.7 billion insurance unicorn Oscar Health.\\\\n\\"},{\\"insert\\":{\\"rule\\":\\"36\\"}},{\\"insert\\":{\\"figure\\":\\"24\\"}},{\\"insert\\":{\\"rule\\":\\"37\\"}},{\\"insert\\":\\"\\\\\\"I called some of my friends from Silicon Valley, some of the best digital marketers in the world, and asked how you scale this stuff,\\\\\\" Kushner says. \\\\\\"They gave me their subcontractors.\\\\\\"\\\\nAt first Kushner dabbled, engaging in what amounted to a beta test using Trump merchandise. \\\\\\"I called somebody who works for one of the technology companies that I work with, and I had them give me a tutorial on how to use Facebook micro-targeting,\\\\\\" Kushner says. Synched with Trump\'s blunt, simple messaging, it worked. The Trump campaign went from selling $8,000 worth of hats and other items a day to $80,000, generating revenue, expanding the number of human billboards\xe2\x80\x94and proving a concept. In another test, Kushner spent $160,000 to promote a series of low-tech policy videos of Trump talking straight into the camera that collectively generated more than 74 million views.\\\\nBy June the GOP nomination secured, Kushner took over all data-driven efforts. Within three weeks, in a nondescript building outside San Antonio, he had built what would become a 100-person data hub designed to unify fundraising, messaging and targeting. Run by Brad Parscale, who had previously built small websites for the Trump Organization, this secret back office would drive every strategic decision during the final months of the campaign. \\\\\\"Our best people were mostly the ones who volunteered for me pro bono,\\\\\\" Kushner says. \\\\\\"People from the business world, people from nontraditional backgrounds.\\\\\\"\\\\nKushner structured the operation with a focus on maximizing the return for every dollar spent. \\\\\\"We played Moneyball, asking ourselves which states will get the best ROI for the electoral vote,\\\\\\" Kushner says. \\\\\\"I asked, How can we get Trump\'s message to that consumer for the least amount of cost?\\\\\\" FEC filings through mid-October indicate the Trump campaign spent roughly half as much as the Clinton campaign did.\\\\n\\"},{\\"insert\\":{\\"rule\\":\\"38\\"}},{\\"insert\\":{\\"figure\\":\\"25\\"}},{\\"insert\\":{\\"rule\\":\\"39\\"}},{\\"insert\\":\\"Just as Trump\'s unorthodox style allowed him to win the Republican nomination while spending far less than his more traditional opponents, Kushner\'s lack of political experience became an advantage. Unschooled in traditional campaigning, he was able to look at the business of politics the way so many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have sized up other bloated industries.\\\\nTelevision and online advertising? Small and smaller. Twitter and Facebook would fuel the campaign, as key tools for not only spreading Trump\'s message but also targeting potential supporters, scraping massive amounts of constituent data and sensing shifts in sentiment in real time.\\\\n\\\\\\"We weren\'t afraid to make changes. We weren\'t afraid to fail. We tried to do things very cheaply, very quickly. And if it wasn\'t working, we would kill it quickly,\\\\\\" Kushner says. \\\\\\"It meant making quick decisions, fixing things that were broken and scaling things that worked.\\\\\\"\\\\nThis wasn\'t a completely raw startup. Kushner\'s crew was able to tap into the Republican National Committee\'s data machine, and it hired targeting partners like Cambridge Analytica to map voter universes and identify which parts of the Trump platform mattered most: trade, immigration or change. Tools like Deep Root drove the scaled-back TV ad spending by identifying shows popular with specific voter blocks in specific regions\xe2\x80\x94say, NCIS for anti-ObamaCare voters or The Walking Dead for people worried about immigration. Kushner built a custom geo-location tool that plotted the location density of about 20 voter types over a live Google Maps interface.\\\\nSoon the data operation dictated every campaign decision: travel, fundraising, advertising, rally locations\xe2\x80\x94even the topics of the speeches. \\\\\\"He put all the different pieces together,\\\\\\" Parscale says. \\\\\\"And what\'s funny is the outside world was so obsessed about this little piece or that, they didn\'t pick up that it was all being orchestrated so well.\\\\\\"\\\\nFor fundraising they turned to machine learning, installing digital marketing companies on a trading floor to make them compete for business. Ineffective ads were killed in minutes, while successful ones scaled. The campaign was sending more than 100,000 uniquely tweaked ads to targeted voters each day. In the end, the richest person ever elected president, whose fundraising effort was rightly ridiculed at the beginning of the year, raised more than $250 million in four months\xe2\x80\x94mostly from small donors.\\\\nAs the election barreled toward its finale, Kushner\'s system, with its high margins and up-to-the-minute voter data, provided both ample cash and the insight on where to spend it. When the campaign registered the fact that momentum in Michigan and Pennsylvania was turning Trump\'s way, Kushner unleashed tailored TV ads, last-minute rallies and thousands of volunteers to knock on doors and make phone calls.\\\\nAnd until the final days of the campaign, he did all this without anyone on the outside knowing about it. For those who can\'t understand how Hillary Clinton could win the popular vote by at least 2 million yet lose handily in the electoral college, perhaps this provides some clarity. If the campaign\'s overarching sentiment was fear and anger, the deciding factor at the end was data and entrepreneurship.\\\\n\\\\\\"Jared understood the online world in a way the traditional media folks didn\'t. He managed to assemble a presidential campaign on a shoestring using new technology and won. That\'s a big deal,\\\\\\" says Schmidt, the Google billionaire. \\\\\\"Remember all those articles about how they had no money, no people, organizational structure?

Take Twitter. While Trump\'s impulsive tweeting to his 15.5 million followers reportedly forced his staff to withhold his phone during parts of the campaign, Kushner\xe2\x80\x94who has had a verified account since April 2009\xe2\x80\x94has never posted a single tweet.\\\\nAnd whereas Trump\'s office is wall-to-wall Donald, a memorabilia-stuffed shrine to ego, the headquarters for the Kushner Companies is sparse and sober. A leather-bound copy of Jewish teachings, the Pirkei Avot, sits on a wooden pedestal in the reception room, and identical silver mezuzahs adorn the side of each office door. The only decoration in his large, terraced boardroom is an oil painting of his grandparents, Holocaust survivors who immigrated to the U.S. after World War II.

During the courtship Kushner had met Donald only a few times in passing when, sensing the relationship was getting serious, he asked Trump for a meeting. Over lunch at the Trump Grill (which Trump briefly made a household name with his infamous taco bowl tweet), they discussed the couple\'s future. \\\\\\"I said, \'Ivanka and I are getting serious, and we\'re starting to go down that path,\'\\\\\\" Kushner says and laughs.\\\\n\\\\\\"He said, \'You\'d better be serious on this.\'\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\\"Jared and my father initially bonded over a combination of me and real estate,\\\\\\" Ivanka Trump says in her Trump Tower offices as dark-suited Secret Service agents stand watch in the halls. \\\\\\"There\'s a lot of parallels between Jared as a developer and my father in the early years of his development career.\\\\\\"\\\\nLike Trump, Kushner grew up outside Manhattan: New Jersey in Kushner\'s case, versus Trump\'s Queens. Also like Trump, Kushner is the son of a man who created a real estate empire in his local market\xe2\x80\x94Charles Kushner eventually controlled 25,000 apartments across the Northeast\xe2\x80\x94and steeped his children in the family business. \\\\\\"My father never really believed in summer camp, so we\'d come with him to the office,\\\\\\" Kushner says. \\\\\\"We\'d go look at jobs, work on construction sites. It taught us real work.\\\\\\" Raised with three siblings in an observant Jewish home in Livingston, New Jersey, Kushner went to a private Jewish high school and then to Harvard (a 2006 book about college admissions would later single out Kushner as a prime example of how children of wealthy donors\xc2\xa0get preferential treatment; administrators quoted within that work later challenged its accuracy, calling it \\\\\\"distorted\\\\\\" and \\\\\\"false\\\\\\"). Next came New York University, for a joint J.D. and M.B.A.\\\\nHis father was a huge supporter of Democrats, giving $1 million to the Democratic National Committee in 2002 and $90,000 to Hillary Clinton\'s Senate run in 2000, and Jared largely followed suit, with more than $60,000 to Democratic committees and $11,000 to Clinton. During grad school Kushner interned for Manhattan\'s longtime district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, before a family scandal upended his life. In 2004 Charles Kushner pleaded guilty to tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness tampering. The latter charge brought national tabloid attention. Angry that his brother-in-law was talking to prosecutors, Charles had paid a prostitute to entrap him\xe2\x80\x94a tryst that he secretly taped and then mailed to his sister.\\\\nJust 24, Jared, as the elder son, suddenly found himself charged with keeping the family together. He saw his mother most days and flew to Alabama to visit his father in prison on most weekends. He also developed a deeper bond with his brother, Josh, who had just started Harvard when the scandal broke. Says Josh, who considers Jared his best friend: \\\\\\"He is the person that I turn to for guidance and support no matter the circumstance.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\\"The whole thing taught me not to worry about the things you can\'t control,\\\\\\" Kushner says. \\\\\\"You can control how you react and can try to make things happen as you want them to. I focus on doing my best to ensure the outcomes. And when it doesn\'t go my way I have to work harder the next time.\\\\\\"\\\\nThat applied to the family business, too, which Kushner now led. To start fresh, he took aim at Manhattan, just as Trump did 40 years before, determined to play in America\'s most lucrative and competitive real estate market.\\\\nThe timing couldn\'t have been worse. His first big purchase as CEO of the Kushner Companies, 666 Fifth, for a record-breaking $1.8 billion, closed in 2007\xe2\x80\x94just in time for the financial crisis. Rents fell, leases broke, funding vanished. To stay solvent, Kushner sold 49% of the building\'s retail space to the Carlyle Group and others for $525 million and seemingly restructured every loan agreement possible, showing a willingness to pay more down the road for room to breathe in the short term. In the end he avoided the kind of bankruptcy maneuvers that Trump pulled in the 1990s and weathered the storm.\\\\nKushner had learned a lesson. Rather than chase top-dollar, blue-chip addresses around New York, he would try to ride up with cooler, up-and-coming neighborhoods, which he has done to the tune of $14 billion worth of acquisitions and developments, in places like Manhattan\'s SoHo and East Village and Brooklyn\'s Dumbo. \\\\\\"Jared brings a youthful perspective, an innovative mind-set, to a very traditional industry that\'s comprised of predominantly 70-year-old men,\\\\\\" Ivanka Trump says. He has also pushed into resurgent areas\xe2\x80\x94Astoria, Queens, and Journal Square in Jersey City\xe2\x80\x94that were once the stomping grounds of Fred Trump and Charles Kushner, respectively.\\\\n\\"},{\\"insert\\":{\\"ad\\":\\"46\\"}},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"drop-cap\\":true,\\"bold\\":true},\\"insert\\":\\"P\\"},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"bold\\":true},\\"insert\\":\\"ART OF THE REASON\\"},{\\"insert\\":\\"\xc2\xa0Jared Kushner has engendered such public interest, besides the power he suddenly wields and the curiosity generated by his near-invisible media presence, is the paradoxes that he represents.\\\\nHe brought the Silicon Valley ethos, which values openness and inclusiveness, to a campaign that promised closed borders, trade protection and religious exclusion. He is the scion of prodigious Democratic donors yet steered a Republican presidential campaign. A grandson of Holocaust survivors who serves a man who has advocated a ban on war refugees. A fact-driven lawyer whose chosen candidate called global warming a hoax, linked vaccines to autism and challenged President Obama\'s citizenship. A media mogul in a campaign stoked by fake news.

What would that say about me if I changed my view based on what other people think, as opposed to the facts that I actually know for myself?\\\\\\"\\\\nRegarding Trump\'s worldview: \\\\\\"I don\'t think it\'s very controversial in an election to become the president of the United States to say that your position is to put America first and to be nationalist as opposed to a globalist.\\\\\\"\\\\nAs for Trump\'s endless stream of statements that insulted and threatened Muslims, Mexicans, women, prisoners of war and U.S. generals, among others? \\\\\\"I just know a lot of the things that people try to attack him with are just not true or overblown or exaggerations. I know his character. I know who he is, and I obviously would not have supported him if I thought otherwise. If the country gives him a chance, they\'ll find he won\'t tolerate hateful rhetoric or behavior.\\\\\\"\\\\nOn his political affiliation, he defines himself thus: \\\\\\"To be determined. I haven\'t made a decision. Things are still evolving as they go.\\\\\\" He adds: \\\\\\"There\'s some aspects of the Democrat Party that didn\'t speak to me, and there are some aspects of the Republican Party that didn\'t speak to me. People in the political world try to put you into different buckets based on what exists. I think Trump\'s creating his own bucket\xe2\x80\x94a blend of what works and eliminating what doesn\'t work.\\\\\\" (Though in using the GOP-favored pejorative \\\\\\"Democrat Party\\\\\\" over the traditional \\\\\\"Democratic Party,\\\\\\" Kushner gives a hint about the contents of his bucket.)\\\\nThe allegations of anti-Semitism hit closer to home. In July, Trump tweeted a graphic of Hillary Clinton against a background of dollar bills and a six-pointed star that contained the words \\\\\\"most corrupt candidate ever,\\\\\\" an image that had allegedly originated on a white supremacist message board. Dana Schwartz, a reporter for Kushner\'s Observer, wrote a widely read piece for the paper\'s site urging her boss, given the prominence he places on his faith and family, to denounce the tweet. Kushner responded with an opinion piece that defended Trump using the same old line: that he knows Trump. \\\\\\"If even the slightest infraction against what the speech police have deemed correct speech is instantly shouted down with taunts of \'racist,\' then what is left to condemn the actual racists?\\\\\\"\\\\nKushner insists today that there will be no hate element in the Trump Administration, starting at the top. \\\\\\"You can\'t not be a racist for 69 years, then all of a sudden become a racist, right?\\\\\\" he says. \\\\\\"You can\'t not be an anti-Semite for 69 years and all of a sudden become an anti-Semite because you\'re running.\\\\\\"\\\\nHis reaction to fringe elements, like the KKK and the white nationalist alt-right, who have embraced Trump? \\\\\\"Trump has disavowed their support 25 times. He\'s renounced hatred, he\'s renounced bigotry, and he\'s renounced racism. I don\'t know if he could ever denounce them enough for some people.\\\\\\" He then paraphrases a quote he attributes to Ronald Reagan: \\\\\\"Just because they support me doesn\'t mean that I support them.\\\\\\"\\\\nKushner\'s support extends to Steve Bannon, Trump\'s strategic advisor, who had been accused by his ex-wife of making anti-Semitic comments (he denies it) and whose website, Breitbart, has often published articles that dog-whistle racist, anti-Semitic sentiments. \\\\\\"Do you hold me accountable for every single thing that the Observer\' s ever written, like they came from me?\\\\\\" Kushner says. \\\\\\"All I know about Steve is my experience working with him. He\'s an incredible Zionist and loves Israel. He was one of the leaders in the anti-divestiture campaign. And what I\'ve seen from working together with him was somebody who did not fit the description that people are pushing on him. I choose to judge him based on my experience and seeing the job he\'s done, as opposed to what other people are saying about him.\\\\\\"\\\\nAnd that seems to reflect how Kushner feels about friends upset by his role in electing someone who offends their values, to the point where, before the election, several wrote to him in fits of pique. \\\\\\"I call it an exfoliation. Anyone who was willing to change a friendship or not do business because of who somebody supports in politics is not somebody who has a lot of character.\\\\n\\\\\\"People are very fickle,\\\\\\" he adds. \\\\\\"You have to find what you believe in, challenge your truths. And if you believe in something, even if it\'s unpopular, you have to push with it.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\"},{\\"insert\\":{\\"ad\\":\\"47\\"}},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"drop-cap\\":true,\\"bold\\":true},\\"insert\\":\\"M\\"},{\\"attributes\\":{\\"bold\\":true},\\"insert\\":\\"ANY OF THOSE\xc2\xa0\\"},{\\"insert\\":\\"fickle friends are likely to return now that Kushner, after masterminding Trump\'s stunning victory, has the ear of the future president. What he will do with that power is anyone\'s guess.\\\\nFor now, Kushner plays coy: \\\\\\"There\'s a lot of people who have been asking me to get involved in a more official capacity. I just have to think about what that means for my family, for my business and make sure it\'d be the right thing for a multitude of reasons.\\\\\\"\\\\nIt\'s unlikely that he can hold a formal position in the Trump White House. Nepotism laws established after President Kennedy made brother Bobby attorney general bar the president from giving government roles to relatives\xe2\x80\x94including in-laws. Reports have stated that the administration is exploring every legal angle to get Kushner into the West Wing\xe2\x80\x94including adding him as an unpaid advisor, though even that may be covered by the law, which was written to ensure fealty to the Constitution rather than the individual.\\\\nBut it may be a moot point. With or without a government title or a $170,000 federal salary, there\'s no law that bans a president from seeking counsel from whomever he wants. It\'s clear America\'s tech and entrepreneurial leaders, who heavily backed Clinton and collectively denounced Trump, will use Kushner as a go-between and that Trump will lean on him just as heavily.\\\\n\\\\\\"I assume he\'ll be in the White House throughout the entire presidency,\\\\\\" says News Corp. billionaire Rupert Murdoch. \\\\\\"For the next four or eight years he\'ll be a strong voice, maybe even the strongest after the vice president.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\"}]","description":"We\'re republishing our finest work from the past 10 years.
