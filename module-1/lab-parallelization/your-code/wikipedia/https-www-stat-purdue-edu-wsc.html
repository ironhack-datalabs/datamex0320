Cleveland has been the Shanti S. Gupta Distinguished Professor\nof Statistics and Courtesy Professor\nof Computer Science at Purdue University since 1/1/2014.\nPrevious to this, he was a\nDistinguished Member of Technical Staff in the Statistics Research\nDepartment at Bell Labs, Murray Hill;\nfor 12 years he was the Department Head.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Education</h3>\n<p align="left">\nCleveland received an A.B. in Mathematics from\nPrinceton University; his\nsenior thesis adviser was William Feller. He received his\nPh.D. in Statistics from Yale University; his Ph.D. thesis adviser\nwas Leonard Jimmie Savage.\n</p>\n\n<h3> Awards and Honors</h3>\n<p>\nIn 2016 Cleveland received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Graphics and\nComputing from the American Statistical Association, the first since 2010.\nIn 2016 he also received the Parzen Prize from Texas A&M University, given\nevery two years since 1994 to a "statistician whose outstanding research\ncontributions include innovations that have had impact on practice". \nIn 1996 he was chosen national Statistician of the Year by the\nChicago Chapter of the American Statistical Association.\nIn 2002 he was selected as a\nHighly Cited Researcher by the American Society for Information\nScience and Technology in the newly formed mathematics category.\nHe has twice won the  Wilcoxon Prize and once won the Youden Prize\nfrom Technometrics. He is a\nFellow of the American Statistical Association,\nthe Institute of Mathematical Statistics,\nand the American Association of the Advancement of Science, and is an\nElected Member of the International Statistical Institute.\n</p>\n\n<h3> Data Science</h3>\n<p>\nIn a talk at the 1999 meeting of the International Statistical Institute\nand in a 2001 paper, number [25] in the list of publications in the above PDF,\nCleveland defined data science as it is used today. It had been used before,\nbut with different meanings. See the Wikipedia Web page\n<a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science"> Data Science</a>.\nThe paper was republished in 2014 [1] together with a discussion and with\nanother paper about D&R with DeltaRho [2], described next,\nwhich requires work in all technical areas of data science.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe technical areas of data science are those that\nhave an impact on how a data analyst analyses data:\n(1) Statistical theory;\n(2) Statistical models;\n(3) Statistical and machine-learning methods;\n(4) Algorithms for statistical and machine-learning methods, and\noptimization;\n(5) Computational systems for data analysis;\n(6) Live analyses of data where results are judged by the findings, not the\nmethodology and systems that where used.\n<p>\n\n<p>\nThe implications for an academic department are that it is not necessary\neach individual to research in all areas. Rather, collectively,\nthe department needs to have research in all areas. There must be an\nexchange of knowledge so that all department members have at least a\nbasic understanding of all areas.\n</p>\n\n</div>\n<div class="span6">\n\n<h3>Areas of Research</h3>\n<p align="left">\nCleveland\'s areas of research have been in statistics,\nmachine learning, data visualization,\ndata analysis for multidisciplinary studies, and high performance computing\nfor deep data analysis.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Data Analysis Projects</h3>\n<p align="left">\nCleveland has been involved in many\nprojects requiring the analysis and modeling of very diverse\ndatasets from many fields, including\ncomputer networking,\nhealthcare engineering,\ntelecommunications,\nhomeland security,\nenvironmental monitoring,\npublic opinion polling,\ncyber security,\nand\nvisual perception. Since circa 2008, many of the analyzed datasets have been\nbig in size and required analytic methods with high computational complexity.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Widely-Used Methods and Their Publication</h3>\n<p align="left">\nIn the course of this work in data analysis, Cleveland\nhas developed many new analytic methods and new computer systems for data\nanalysis that are used throughout the worldwide technical community.\nHe has published  129 papers and 3 books on this work.\nSee the PDF above for a chronological list. For citations to the publications,\nsee the Web page\n<a href= "http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en\\&user=ds52UHcAAAAJ/">\nGoogle Citations\n</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Data Visualization</h3>\n<p align="left">\nIn data visualization,\nCleveland has written two books, co-authored another\nand one user\'s manual, and was the Editor of two books and\na special issue of the Journal of the American Statistical Association.\nHe is the founder of the Graphics Section of the American\nStatistical Association, which means he led the group that successfully\npetitioned the ASA board of directors for approval.\n</p>\n<p align="left">\nHis two books on data visualization\nhave been reviewed in many journals from a wide\nvariety of disciplines.\nThe Elements of Graphing Data was selected for the Library of Science Book\nClub.  J. Lodge reviewed it in Atmospheric Environment\nand wrote:\n<i>\n"certain kinds of tendency toward\nbad graphics could be cured if as many\nauthors as possible would not just read,\nbut, in the words of the Anglican Prayer\nBook, `learn, mark, and inwardly digest\'\nthis volume."\n</i>\nB. Gunter reviewed Visualizing Data in Technometrics and wrote:\n<i>\n"This is a terrific book --- in my opinion, a path-breaking book.\nGet it.  Read it.  Practice what it preaches. You will improve\nthe quality of your data analysis."\n</i>\n</p>\n<p align="left">\nCleveland and colleagues developed  trellis display, a powerful framework\nfor data visualization.  It has been used by a large,\nworldwide community of data analysts as a result of its implementation in\nthe two software systems based on the S language, the S-Plus commercial\nsystem and the R open source system.\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</div><!--endofrow-->\n</div><!--endofcontainer-->\n\n   <div class="inner">\n   <header class="jumbotron masthead">\n   <h2 align="center">Current Research</h2>\n   </header>\n      </div>\n\n   <div class="container">\n      <div class="row">\n         <div class="span6">\n\n<h3>The Term "Big Data" Misses Badly</h3>\n<p>\nThe widely used term ``big data\'\' carries with it a notion of computational\nperformance for the analysis of big datasets. But for data analysis,\ncomputational performance depends very heavily, not just on size, but on\nthe computational complexity of the analytic routines used in the analysis.\nData small in size can be a big challenge, too. Furthermore, the hardware\npower available to the data analyst is an important factor.\n</p>\n\n<h3>High Performance Computing for Deep Data Analysis</h3>\n<p>\nCleveland\'s current research is in High Performance Computing for Deep Data\nAnalysis (HPC-DDA). The goal is to enable both deep analysis and HPC.\n\n<p>\nHPC means computations are feasible and practical for wide ranges of dataset\nsize, computational complexity, and hardware power.  \nDeep analysis means analyzing data\nat their finest granularity, and not just summary statistics.\nDeep analysis also means that the analyst can apply any of 1000s of methods of\nstatistics, machine learning, and data visualization.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe goal is achieved by work in the Divide & Recombine (D&R) statistical\napproach to analysis, and the DeltaRho D&R software implementation that makes\nprogramming D&R easy.\nThe work ranges from statistical theory to cluster design, covering all\nof the areas of data science; furthermore, work in the different areas is\nhighly integrated, one area affecting another. Integrated work in data\nscience is necessary to succeed.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class="span6">\n<h3> Divide and Recombine (D&R) </h3>\nCleveland and colleagues have been developing D&R since\n2009. In D&R, the data are divided into subsets (div), analytic\nmethods are applied to each subset independently without communication\nbetween subsets (ana), and the subsets\' outputs for each\nmethod are recombined (rec).\n\nResearch in statistical theory seeks division\nmethods and recombination methods to optimize the statistical accuracy\nof D&R results. While D&R is a statistical approach, its goal is\nHPC.  Most of the D&R computation is embarrassingly\nparallel, the simplest and fastest parallel  computation.\n\n<h3> DeltaRho </h3>\nDeltaRho D&R software runs on a cluster. The front end has R and\nthe DeltaRho datadr R package that makes D&R programing easy.\nThe back end, the Hadoop distributed file system and parallel compute engine,\nexecutes the datadr/R commands: (div), (ana), and (rec). In between, the R\npackage RHIPE (R and Hadoop Integrated Programming Environment) provides\ncommunication between datadr and Hadoop.\n\n<h3>PhD Students</h3>\n<p>\nCleveland is currently the advisor for 6 students;\nsince joining Purdue in 2004, he has advised 18 students.\nThe students have made major contributions to research in D&R with DeltaRho.\n</p>\n\n<h3> More Information </h3>\nFor more information\nsee the Web page <a href= "http://deltarho.org">deltarho.org</a>\nand papers [2-3],[7], [12] in the above PDF.\n\n</div>\n\n</div><!--endofrow-->\n</div><!--endofcontainer-->\n\n\n<br>\n\n<div class="container">\n\n      <footer>\n   <p> Built using <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap</a></p>\n        <p>&copy;  Department Of Statistics, Purdue University 12/11/15</p>\n      </footer>\n</div>\n\n<script src="assets/jquery.js"></script>\n<script src="assets/bootstrap-dropdown.js"></script>\n\n  </body>\n</html>\n'
